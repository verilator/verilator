What Verilator Does
===================

Verilator is invoked with parameters similar to GCC or Synopsys's VCS.  It
"Verilates" the specified Verilog or SystemVerilog code by reading it,
performing lint checks, and optionally inserting assertion checks and
coverage-analysis points. It outputs single- or multi-threaded .cpp and .h
files, the "Verilated" code.

The user writes a little C++/SystemC wrapper file, which instantiates the
"Verilated" model of the user's top level module. These C++/SystemC files
are then compiled by a C++ compiler (gcc/clang/MSVC++). The resulting
executable performs the design simulation. Verilator also supports linking
its generated libraries, optionally encrypted, into other simulators.

Verilator may not be the best choice if you are expecting a full featured
replacement for NC-Verilog, VCS or another commercial Verilog simulator, or
if you are looking for a behavioral Verilog simulator e.g. for a quick
class project (we recommend `Icarus Verilog`_ for this.) However, if you
are looking for a path to migrate SystemVerilog to C++ or SystemC, or your
team is comfortable writing just a touch of C++ code, Verilator is the tool
for you.


Performance
===========

Verilator does not simply convert Verilog HDL to C++ or SystemC. Rather,
Verilator compiles your code into a much faster optimized and optionally
thread-partitioned model, which is in turn wrapped inside a C++/SystemC
module. The results are a compiled Verilog model that executes even on a
single-thread over 10x faster than standalone SystemC, and on a single
thread is about 100 times faster than interpreted Verilog simulators such
as `Icarus Verilog`_. Another 2-10x speedup might be gained from
multithreading (yielding 200-1000x total over interpreted simulators).

Verilator has typically similar or better performance versus the
closed-source Verilog simulators (Carbon Design Systems Carbonator,
Modelsim, Cadence Incisive/NC-Verilog, Synopsys VCS, VTOC, and Pragmatic
CVer/CVC). But, Verilator is open-sourced, so you can spend on computes
rather than licenses. Thus Verilator gives you the best cycles/dollar.

For more information on how Verilator stacks up to some of the other
closed-sourced and open-sourced Verilog simulators, see the `Verilog
Simulator Benchmarks
<https://www.veripool.org/verilog_sim_benchmarks.html>`_.  (If you
benchmark Verilator, please see the notes in the `Verilator manual (PDF)
<https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.pdf>`_, and also if possible post on
the forums the results; there may be additional tweaks possible.)
