Thanks for taking the time to report this.

Can you attach an example that shows the issue?  (Must be openly licensed, ideally in test_regress format.)

What 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?

What OS and distribution are you using?

May we assist you in trying to fix this in Verilator yourself?
