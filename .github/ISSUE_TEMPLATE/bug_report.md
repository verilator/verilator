Thanks for taking the time to report this.

Can you attach an example that shows the issue?  (Must be openly licensed, ideally in test_regress format.)

What 'verilator --version' are you using?  Did you try it with the git master version?

Would you be willing to try to fix Verilator yourself with assistance?
