     See documentation, as the file descriptors differ from the standard.

* Verilator 3.510 12/17/2005 Stable

**   Improve trace-on performance on large multi-clock designs by 2x or more.
     This adds a small ~2% performance penalty if traces are compiled in,
     but not turned on.  For best non-tracing performance, do not use --trace.

**   Support multi-dimensional arrays.  [Eugen Fekete]

**   Add very limited support for the Property Specification Language
     (aka PSL or Sugar).  The format and keywords are now very limited, but will
     grow with future releases.  The --assert switch enables this feature.

**   With --assert, generate assertions for synthesis parallel_case and full_case.

**** Fix generate if's with empty if/else blocks.  [Mat Zeno]

**** Fix generate for cell instantiations with same name.  [Mat Zeno]

* Verilator 3.481 10/12/2005 Stable

***  Add /*verilator tracing_on/off*/ for waveform control.

**** Fix split optimization reordering $display statements.

* Verilator 3.480 9/27/2005 Beta

**   Allow coverage of flattened modules, and multiple points per line.
     Coverage analysis requires SystemPerl 1.230 or newer.

**** Add preprocessor changes to support meta-comments.

**** Optimize sequential assignments of different bits of same bus; ~5% faster.

**** Optimize away duplicate lookup tables.

**** Optimize wide concatenates into individual words.  [Ralf Karge]

* Verilator 3.464 8/24/2005 Stable

***  Add `systemc_imp_header, for use when using --output-split.

***  Add --stats option to dump design statistics.

**** Fix core dump with clock inversion optimizations.

* Verilator 3.463 8/5/2005 Stable

* Verilator 3.462 8/3/2005 Stable

***  Fix reordering of delayed assignments to same memory index. [Wim Michiels]

**** Fix compile error with Flex 2.5.1.  [Jens Arm]

**** Fix multiply-instantiated public tasks generating non-compilable code.

* Verilator 3.461 7/28/2005 Beta

**** Fix compile error with older versions of bison.  [Jeff Dutton]

* Verilator 3.460 7/27/2005 Beta

**   Add -output-split option to enable faster parallel GCC compiles.
     To support --output-split, the makefiles now split VM_CLASSES
     into VM_CLASSES_FAST and VM_CLASSES_SLOW.  This may require a
     change to local makefiles.

**   Support -v argument to read library files.

***  When issuing unoptimizable warning, show an example path.

**** Fix false warning when a clock is constant.

**** Fix X/Z in decimal numbers.  [Wim Michiels]

**** Fix genvar statements in non-named generate blocks.

**** Fix core dump when missing newline in `define.  [David van der bokke]

**** Internal tree dumps now indicate edit number that changed the node.

* Verilator 3.450 7/12/2005

**   $finish will no longer exit, but set Verilated::gotFinish().
     This enables support for final statements, and for other cleanup code.
     If this is undesired, redefine the vl_user_finish routine.  Top level
     loops should use Verilated::gotFinish() as a exit condition for their
     loop, and then call top->final().  To prevent a infinite loop, a
     double $finish will still exit; this may be removed in future
     releases.

***  Add support for SystemVerilog keywords $bits, $countones, $isunknown,
     $onehot, $onehot0, always_comb, always_ff, always_latch, finish.

**** Fix "=== 1'bx" to always be false, instead of random.

* Verilator 3.440 6/28/2005 Stable

**   Add Verilog 2001 generate for/if/case statements.

* Verilator 3.431 6/24/2005 Stable

***  Fix selection bugs introduced in 3.430 beta.

* Verilator 3.430 6/22/2005 Beta

**   Add Verilog 2001 variable part selects [n+:m] and [n-:m].  [Wim Michiels]

* Verilator 3.422 6/10/2005 Stable

***  Added Verilog 2001 power (**) operator.  [Danny Ding]

**** Fixed crash and added error message when assigning to inputs.  [Ralf Karge]

**** Fixed tracing of modules with public functions.

* Verilator 3.421 6/2/2005 Beta

**** Fixed error about reserved word on non-public signals.

**** Fixed missing initialization compile errors in 3.420 beta. [Ralf Karge]

* Verilator 3.420 6/2/2005 Beta

***  Fixed case defaults when not last statement in case list. [Ralf Karge]

**** Added error message when multiple defaults in case statement.

**** Fixed crash when wire self-assigns x=x.

**   Performance improvements worth ~20%

**   Added -x-assign options; ~5% faster if use -x-assign=0.

**** Optimize shifts out of conditionals and if statements.

**** Optimize local 'short' wires.

**** Fixed gate optimization with top-flattened modules. [Mahesh Kumashikar]

* Verilator 3.411 5/30/2005 Stable

**** Fixed compile error in GCC 2.96.  [Jeff Dutton]

* Verilator 3.410 5/25/2005 Beta

**   Allow functions and tasks to be declared public.
     They will become public C++ functions, with appropriate C++ types.
     This allows users to make public accessor functions/tasks, instead
     of having to use public variables and `systemc_header hacks.

***  Skip producing output files if all inputs are identical
     This uses timestamps, similar to make.  Disable with --no-skip-identical.

**** Improved compile performance with large case statements.

**** Fixed internal error in V3Table.  [Jeff Dutton]

**** Fixed compile error in GCC 2.96, and with SystemC 1.2.  [Jeff Dutton]

* Verilator 3.400 4/29/2005 Beta

**   Internal changes to support future clocking features.

**   Verilog-Perl and SystemPerl are no longer required for C++ or SystemC
     output.  If you want tracing or coverage analysis, they are still needed.

***  Added --sc to create pure SystemC output not requiring SystemPerl.

***  Added --pins64 to create 64 bit SystemC outputs instead of sc_bv<64>.

***  The --exe flag is now required to produce executables inside the makefile.
     This was previously the case any time .cpp files were passed on the
     command line.

***  Added -O3 and --inline-mult for performance tuning.  [Ralf Karge]
     One experiment regained 5% performance, at a cost of 300% in compile time.

***  Improved performance of large case/always statements with low fanin
     by converting to internal lookup tables (ROMs).

***  Initialize SystemC port names.  [S Shuba]

**** Added Doxygen comments to Verilated includes.

**** Fixed -cc pins 8 bits wide and less to be uint8_t instead of uint16_t.

**** Fixed crash when Mdir has same name as .v file.  [Gernot Koch]

**** Fixed crash with size mismatches on case items.  [Gernot Koch]

* Verilator 3.340 2/18/2005 Stable

***  Report misconnected pins across all modules, instead of just first error.

**** Fixed over-active inlining, resulting in compile slowness.

**** Improved large netlist compile times.

**** Added additional internal assertions.

* Verilator 3.332 1/27/2005

***  Added -E preprocess only flag, similar to GCC.

***  Added CMPCONSTLR when comparison is constant due to > or < with all ones.

**** Fixed loss of first -f file argument, introduced in 3.331.

* Verilator 3.331 1/18/2005

**   The Verilog::Perl preprocessor is now C++ code inside of Verilator.
     This improves performance, makes compilation easier, and enables
     some future features.

***  Support arrays of instantiations (non-primitives only). [Wim Michiels]

**** Fixed unlinked error with defparam.  [Shawn Wang]

* Verilator 3.320 12/10/2004

**   NEWS is now renamed Changes, to support CPAN indexing.

***  If Verilator is passed a C file, create a makefile link rule.
     This saves several user steps when compiling small projects.

***  Added new COMBDLY warning in place of fatal error.  [Shawn Wang]

***  Fixed mis-simulation with wide-arrays under bit selects.  [Ralf Karge]

**** Added NC Verilog as alternative to VCS for reference tests.

**** Support implicit wire declarations on input-only signals.
     (Dangerous, as leads to wires without drivers, but allowed by spec.)

**** Fixed compile warnings on Suse 9.1

* Verilator 3.311 11/29/2004

**   Support implicit wire declarations (as a warning).  [Shawn Wang]

**** Fixed over-shift difference in Verilog vs C++.  [Ralf Karge]

* Verilator 3.310 11/15/2004

**   Support defparam.

**   Support gate primitives: buf, not, and, nand, or, nor, xor, xnor.

***  Ignore all specify blocks.

* Verilator 3.302 11/12/2004

***  Support NAND and NOR operators.

***  Better warnings when port widths don't match.

**** Fixed internal error due to some port width mismatches. [Ralf Karge]

**** Fixed WIDTH warnings on modules that are only used
     parameterized, not in 'default' state.

**** Fixed selection of SystemC library on cygwin systems. [Shawn Wang]

**** Fixed runtime bit-selection of parameter constants.

* Verilator 3.301 11/04/2004

**** Fixed 64 bit [31:0] = {#{}} mis-simulation.  [Ralf Karge]

**** Fixed shifts greater then word width mis-simulation.  [Ralf Karge]

**** Work around GCC 2.96 negation bug.

* Verilator 3.300 10/21/2004

**   New backend that eliminates most VL_ macros.
     Improves performance 20%-50%, depending on frequency of use of signals
     over 64 bits. GCC compile times with -O2 shrink by a factor of 10.

**** Fixed "setting unsigned int from signed value" warning.

* Verilator 3.271 10/21/2004

**** Fixed "loops detected" error with some negedge clocks.

**** Cleaned up some output code spacing issues.

* Verilator 3.270 10/15/2004

***  Support Verilog 2001 parameters in module headers. [Ralf Karge]

**** Suppress numeric fault when dividing by zero.

**** Faster code to support compilers not inlining all Verilated functions.

* Verilator 3.260 10/7/2004

**   Support Verilog 2001 named parameter instantiation. [Ralf Karge]

**** Return 1's when one bit wide extract indexes outside array bounds.

**** Fixed compile warnings on 64-bit operating systems.

* Verilator 3.251 9/9/2004

**** Fixed parenthesis overflow in Microsoft Visual C++ [Renga Sundararajan]

* Verilator 3.250 8/30/2004

**   Support Microsoft Visual C++ [Renga Sundararajan]

***  SystemPerl 1.161+ is required.

* Verilator 3.241 8/17/2004

**   Support ,'s to separate multiple assignments. [Paul Nitza]

**** Fixed shift sign extension problem using non-GCC compilers.

* Verilator 3.240 8/13/2004

**   Verilator now uses 64 bit math where appropriate.
     Inputs and outputs of 33-64 bits wide to the C++ Verilated model must
     now be uint64_t's; SystemC has not changed, they will remain sc_bv's.
     This increases performance by ~ 9% on x86 machines, varying with how
     frequently 33-64 bit signals occur.  Signals 9-16 bits wide are now
     stored as 16 bit shorts instead of longs, this aids cache packing.

**** Fixed SystemC compile error with feedthrus. [Paul Nitza]

**** Fixed concat value error introduced in 3.230.

* Verilator 3.230 8/10/2004

***  Added coverage output to test_sp example, SystemPerl 1.160+ is required.

**** Fixed time 0 value of signals. [Hans Van Antwerpen]
     Earlier versions would not evaluate some combinatorial signals
     until posedge/negedge blocks had been activated.

**** Fixed wide constant inputs to public submodules [Hans Van Antwerpen]

**** Fixed wide signal width extension bug.
     Only applies when width mismatch warnings were overridden.

* Verilator 3.220 6/22/2004

**   Many waveform tracing changes:

***  Tracing is now supported on C++ standalone simulations. [John Brownlee]

***  When tracing, SystemPerl 1.150 or newer is required.

***  When tracing, Verilator must be called with the --trace switch.

**** Added SystemPerl example to documentation.  [John Brownlee]

**** Various Cygwin compilation fixes.  [John Brownlee]

* Verilator 3.210 4/1/2004

**   Compiler optimization switches have changed
     See the BENCHMARKING section of the documentation.

***  With Verilog-Perl 2.3 or newer, Verilator supports SystemVerilog
     preprocessor extensions.

***  Added localparam. [Thomas Hawkins]

***  Added warnings for SystemVerilog reserved words.

* Verilator 3.203 3/10/2004

***  Notes and repairs for Solaris. [Fred Ma]

* Verilator 3.202 1/27/2004

**   The beta version is now the primary release.  See below for many changes.
     If you have many problems, you may wish to try release 3.125.

***  Verilated::traceEverOn(true) must be called at time 0 if you will ever
     turn on tracing (waveform dumping) of signals.  Future versions will
     need this switch to disable trace incompatible optimizations.

**** Fixed several tracing bugs

**** Added optimizations for common replication operations.

* Verilator 3.201-beta 12/10/2003

**   BETA VERSION, USE 3.124 for stable release!

**   Version 3.2XX includes a all new back-end.
     This includes automatic inlining, flattening of signals between
     hierarchy, and complete ordering of statements.  This results in
     60-300% execution speedups, though less pretty C++ output.  Even
     better results are possible using GCC 3.2.2 (part of Redhat 9.1), as
     GCC has fixed some optimization problems which Verilator exposes.

     If you are using `systemc_ctor, beware pointers to submodules are now
     initialized after the constructor is called for a module, to avoid
     segfaults, move statements that reference subcells into initial
     statements.

***  C++ Constructor that creates a verilog module may take a char* name.
     This name will be used to prefix any $display %m arguments, so users may
     distinguish between multiple Verilated modules in a single executable.

* Verilator 3.125 1/27/2004

**** Optimization of bit replications

* Verilator 3.124 12/05/2003

***  A optimized executable will be made by default, in addition to a debug
     executable.  Invoking Verilator with --debug will pick the debug version.

**** Many minor invisible changes to support the next version.

* Verilator 3.123 11/10/2003

**** Wide bus performance enhancements.

**** Fixed function call bug when width warning suppressed. [Leon Wildman]

**** Fixed __DOT__ compile problem with funcs in last revision. [Leon Wildman]

* Verilator 3.122 10/29/2003

***  Modules which are accessed from external code now must be marked with
     /*verilator public_module*/ unless they already contain public signals.
     To enforce this, private cell names now have a string prepended.

**** Fixed replicated function calls in one statement. [Robert A. Clark]

**** Fixed function call bug when width warning suppressed. [Leon Wildman]

* Verilator 3.121 09/29/2003

***  Support multiplication over 32 bits. [Chris Boumenot]
     Also improved speed of addition and subtraction over 32 bits.

***  Detect bit selection out of range errors.

***  Detect integer width errors.

**** Fixed width problems on function arguments. [Robert A. Clark]

* Verilator 3.120 09/24/2003

***  $finish now exits the model (via vl_finish function).

***  Support inputs/outputs in tasks.

***  Support V2K "integer int = {INITIAL_VALUE};"

***  Ignore floating point delay values.  [Robert A. Clark]

**** Ignore `celldefine, `endcelldefine, etc. [Robert A. Clark]

**** New optimizations on reduction operators.

**** Fixed converting "\ooo" into octal values.

**** Fixed $display("%x");

* Verilator 3.112 09/16/2003

**** Fixed functions in continuous assignments. [Robert A. Clark]

**** Fixed inlining of modules with 2-level deep outputs.

* Verilator 3.111 09/15/2003

**** Fixed declaration of functions before using that module. [Robert A. Clark]

**** Fixed module inlining bug with outputs.

* Verilator 3.110 09/12/2003

**   Support Verilog 2001 style input/output declarations. [Robert A. Clark]

***  Allow local vars in headers of function/tasks. [Leon Wildman]

* Verilator 3.109 08/28/2003

**   Added support for local variables in named begin blocks. [Leon Wildman]

* Verilator 3.108 08/11/2003

**   Added support for functions.

***  Signals 8 bits and shorter are now stored as chars
     instead of uint32_t's.  This improves Dcache packing and
     improves performance by ~7%.

**** $display now usually results in a single VL_PRINT rather then many.

**** Many optimizations involving conditionals (?:)

* Verilator 3.107 07/15/2003

***  --private and --l2name are now the default,
     as this enables additional optimizations.
     Use --noprivate or --nol2name to get the older behavior.

***  Now support $display of binary and wide format data.

***  Added detection of incomplete case statements,
     and added related optimizations worth ~4%.

**** Work around flex bug in Redhat 8.0.  [Eugene Weber]

**** Added some additional C++ reserved words.

**** Additional constant optimizations, ~5% speed improvement.

* Verilator 3.106 06/17/2003

** $c can now take multiple expressions as arguments.
   For example $c("foo","bar(",32+1,");") will insert "foobar(33);"
   This makes it easier to pass the values of signals.

** Several changes to support future versions that may have
   signal-eliminating optimizations.  Users should try to use these switch
   on designs, they will become the default in later versions.

*** Added --private switch and /*verilator public*/ metacomment.
    This renames all signals so that compile errors will result if any
    signals referenced by C++ code are missing a /*verilator public*/
    metacomment.

*** With --l2name, the second level cell C++ cell is now named "v".
    Previously it was named based on the name of the verilog code.  This
    means to get to signals, scope to "{topcell} ->v ->{mysignal}" instead
    of "{topcell} ->{verilogmod}. {mysignal}".  This allows different
    modules to be substituted for the cell without requiring source
    changes.

**** Several cleanups for Redhat 8.0.

* Verilator 3.105 05/08/2003

**** Fixed more GCC 3.2 errors. [David Black]

* Verilator 3.104 04/30/2003

*** Indicate direction of ports with VL_IN and VL_OUT.

*** Allow $c32, etc, to specify width of the $c statement for VCS.

**** Fixed false "indent underflow" error inside `systemc_ctor sections.

**** Fixed missing ordering optimizations when outputs also used internally.

*** Numerous performance improvements, worth about 25%

     Bleiweiss]

* Verilator 3.005  10/21/2002

**** Fixed X's in case (not casex/z) to constant propagate correctly.

**** Fixed missing include. [Kurachi]

* Verilator 3.004  10/10/2002

*** Added /* verilator module_inline */ and associated optimizations.

*** Allow /* verilator coverage_block_off */ in place of `coverage_block_off.
    This prevents problems with Emacs AUTORESET. [Ray Strouble]

**** Fixed `coverage_block_off also disabling subsequent blocks.

**** Fixed unrolling of loops with multiple simple statements.

**** Fixed compile warnings on newer GCC. [Kurachi]

**** Additional concatenation optimizations.

* Verilator 3.003  09/13/2002

*** Now compiles on Windows 2000 with Cygwin.

**** Fixed bug with pin assignments to wide memories.

**** Optimize wire assignments to constants.

* Verilator 3.002  08/19/2002

** First public release of version 3.

* Verilator 3.000  08/03/2002

** All new code base.  Many changes too numerous to mention.

*** Approximately 4 times faster then Verilator 2.
*** Supports initial statements
*** Supports correct blocking/nonblocking assignments
*** Supports `defines across multiple modules
*** Optimizes call ordering, constant propagation, and dead code elimination.

* Verilator 2.1.8 04/03/2002

** All applications must now link against include/verilated.cpp

*** Paths specified to verilator_make should be absolute, or be formed
   to allow for execution in the object directory (prepend ../ to each path.)
   This allows relative filenames for makes which hash and cache dependencies.

**** Added warning when parameter constants are too large. [John Deroo]

**** Added warning when x/?'s used in non-casez statements.

**** Added warning when blocking assignments used in posedge blocks. [Dan Lussier]

**** Split evaluation function into clocked and non-clocked, 20% perf gain.

* Verilator 2.1.5 12/1/2001

** Added coverage analysis.  In conjunction with SystemC provide line
   coverage reports, without SystemC, provide a hook to user written
   accumulation function.  See --coverage option of verilator_make.

*** Relaxed multiply range checking

*** Support for constants up to 128 bits

*** Randomize values used when assigning to X's.

**** Added -guard option of internal testing.

**** Changed indentation in emitted code to be automatically generated.

**** Fixed corruption of assignments of signal over 32 bits with non-0 lsb.

* Verilator 2.1.4 11/16/2001

** Added $c("c_commands();");  for embedding arbitrary C code in Verilog.

* Verilator 2.1.3 11/03/2001

** Support for parameters.

* Verilator 2.1.2 10/25/2001

** Verilog Errors now reference the .v file rather then the .vpp file.

*** Support strings in assignments:  reg [31:0] foo = "STRG";

*** Support %m in format strings.  Ripped out old $info support, use
    Verilog-Perl's vpm program instead.

*** Convert $stop to call of v_stop() which user can define.

**** Fixed bug where a==b==c would have wrong precedence rule.

**** Fixed bug where XNOR on odd-bit-widths (~^ or ^~) had bad value.

* Verilator 2.1.1 5/17/2001

** New test_sp directory for System-Perl (SystemC) top level instantiation
of the Verilated code, lower modules are still C++ code.  (Experimental).

** New test_spp directory for Pure System-Perl (SystemC) where every module
is true SystemC code.  (Experimental)

*** Input ports are now loaded by pointer reference into the sub-cell.
This is faster on I-386 machines, as the stack must be used when there are
a large number of parameters.  Also, this simplifies debugging as the value
of input ports exists for tracing.

**** Many code cleanups towards standard C++ style conventions.

* Verilator 2.1.0 5/8/2001

**** Many code cleanups towards standard C++ style conventions.

* {Version history lost}

* Verilator 1.8 7/8/1996

* Verilator 1.7 5/20/1996

****  Mask unused bits of DONTCAREs.

* Verilator 1.6 5/13/1996

*** Added fasttrace script

* Verilator 1.5 1/9/1996

*** Pass structure pointer into translated code,
    so multiple instances can use same functions.

**** Fix static value concat on casex items.

* Verilator 1.1 3/30/1995

*** Bug fixes, added verimake_partial script, performance improvements.

* Verilator 1.0c 9/30/1994
