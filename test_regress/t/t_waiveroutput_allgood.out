// DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: Waivers generated with --waiver-output

`verilator_config

// Below you find suggested waivers. You have three options:
//   1. Fix the reason for the linter warning
//   2. Keep the waiver permanently if you are sure this is okay
//   3. Keep the waiver temporarily to suppress the output

// No waivers needed - great!
