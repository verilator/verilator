Summary:
  Total elapsed time = 23415 rdtsc ticks
  Parallelized code  = 82.51% of elapsed time
  Waiting time       = 8.54% of elapsed time
  Total threads      = 2
  Total CPUs used    = 2
  Total mtasks       = 8
  Total yields       = 0

NUMA assignment:
  NUMA status        = 0,1,4,5;2,3,6,7

Parallelized code, measured:
  Thread utilization =  24.72%
  Speedup            =  0.494x

Parallelized code, predicted during static scheduling:
  Thread utilization =  69.82%
  Speedup            =    1.4x

All code, measured:
  Thread utilization =  29.14%
  Speedup            =  0.583x

All code, measured, scaled by predicted speedup:
  Thread utilization =  62.40%
  Speedup            =   1.25x

MTask statistics:
  Longest mtask id = 6
  Longest mtask time = 17.70% of time elapsed in parallelized code
  min log(p2e) = -4.736  from mtask 6 (predict 30, elapsed 3420)
  max log(p2e) = -2.409  from mtask 8 (predict 107, elapsed 1190)
  mean = -3.325
  stddev = 0.692
  e ^ stddev = 1.998
