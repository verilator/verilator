= How to contribute to Verilator

Thanks for using Verilator!  We welcome your contributions in whatever form.

This contributing document contains some suggestions that may make
contributions flow more efficiently.

==== Did you find a bug?

* Please **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching
  https://verilator.org/issues[Verilator Issues].

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  https://verilator.org/issues/new[open a new issue].

** Be sure to include a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
   demonstrating the bug and expected behavior that is not occurring.

** The ideal example works against other simulators, and is in the
   test_regress/t test format, as described in
   link:internals.adoc[docs/internals].

==== Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Please https://verilator.org/issues/new[Open a new issue].

* You may attach a patch to the issue, or (preferred) may point to a GitHub
  repository branch within your GitHub account.

** Verilator uses Travis CI to provide continuous integration. You may
   want to setup Travis CI on your GitHub branch to ensure your changes
   keep the tests passing.  See link:internals.adoc[docs/internals].

* Your source-code contributions must be certified as open source, under
  the https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of
  Origin]. On your first contribution, you must either:

** Have your patch include the addition of your name to
   link:CONTRIBUTORS[docs/CONTRIBUTORS] (preferred).

** Use "git -s" as part of your commit. This adds a "signed-of-by"
   attribute which will certify your contribution as described in the
   https://github.com/wking/signed-off-by/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches[Signed-of-By
   convention].

** Email, or post in an issue a statement that you certify your
   contributions.

** In any of these cases your name will be added to
   link:CONTRIBUTORS[docs/CONTRIBUTORS] and you are agreeing all future
   contributions are also certified.

** We occasionally accept contributions where people do not want their
   name published. Please email us; you must still certify your
   contribution using email.

* Your test contributions are generally considered released into the public
  domain, unless you request otherwise or put a GNU/Artistic license on
  your test file.

* Most important is we get your patch. If you'd like to clean up
  indentation and related issues ahead of our feedback, that is
  appreciated; please see the coding conventions in
  link:internals.adoc[docs/internals].

==== Do you have questions?

* Please see FAQ section and rest of the
  https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.html[Verilator manual],
  or https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.pdf[Verilator manual (PDF)].

* Ask any question in the
  https://verilator.org/forum[Verilator forum].

==== Code of Conduct

* Our contributors and participants pledge to make participation in our
  project and our community a positive experience for everyone.  We follow
  the https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html[Contributor
