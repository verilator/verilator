Contributing to Verilator
=========================

Thanks for using Verilator! We welcome your contributions in whatever form.

This contributing document contains some suggestions that may make
contributions flow more efficiently.


Did you find a bug?
-------------------

- Please **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching
  `Verilator Issues <https://verilator.org/issues>`__.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, `open a
  new Verilator issue <https://verilator.org/issues/new>`__.

  - Be sure to include a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
    demonstrating the bug and expected behavior that is not occurring.

  - The ideal example works against other simulators, and is in the
    test_regress/t test format, as described in `docs/internals
    <internals.rst>`__.


Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
---------------------------------------

- Please `Open a new issue <https://verilator.org/issues/new>`__.

- You may attach a patch to the issue, or (preferred) may request a
  GitHub pull request.

  - Verilator uses GitHub Actions to provide continuous integration.  You
    may want to enable Actions on your GitHub branch to ensure your changes
    keep the tests passing. See `docs/internals <internals.rst>`__.

- Your source-code contributions must be certified as open source,
  under the `Developer Certificate of
  Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>`__. On your first
  contribution, you must either:

  - Have your patch include the addition of your name to `docs/CONTRIBUTORS
    <CONTRIBUTORS>`__ (preferred).

  - Use "git -s" as part of your commit. This adds a "signed-of-by"
    attribute which will certify your contribution as described in the
    `Signed-of-By convention
    <https://github.com/wking/signed-off-by/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches>`__.

  - Email, or post in an issue a statement that you certify your
    contributions.

  - In any of these cases your name will be added to `docs/CONTRIBUTORS
    <CONTRIBUTORS>`__ and you are agreeing all future contributions are
    also certified.

  - We occasionally accept contributions where people do not want their
    name published. Please email us; you must still privately certify your
    contribution.

- Your test contributions are generally considered released into the
  Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0), unless you request otherwise or
  put a GNU/Artistic license on your file.

- Most important is we get your patch. If you’d like to clean up
  indentation and related issues ahead of our feedback, that is
  appreciated; please see the coding conventions in `docs/internals
  <internals.rst>`__.


Do you have questions?
----------------------

- Please see FAQ section and rest of the `Verilator
  manual <https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.html>`__, or `Verilator
  manual (PDF) <https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.pdf>`__.

- Ask any question in the `Verilator forum
  <https://verilator.org/forum>`__.
