Code Flows
==========


Verilator Flow
--------------

The main flow of Verilator can be followed by reading the Verilator.cpp
``process()`` function:

1.  First, the files specified on the command line are read. Reading
    involves preprocessing, then lexical analysis with Flex and parsing
    with Bison. This produces an abstract syntax tree (AST)
    representation of the design, which is what is visible in the .tree
    files described below.

2.  Verilator then makes a series of passes over the AST, progressively
    refining and optimizing it.

3.  Cells in the AST first linked, which will read and parse additional
    files as above.

4.  Functions, variable and other references are linked to their
    definitions.

5.  Parameters are resolved and the design is elaborated.

6.  Verilator then performs many additional edits and optimizations on
    the hierarchical design. This includes coverage, assertions, X
    elimination, inlining, constant propagation, and dead code
    elimination.

7.  References in the design are then pseudo-flattened. Each module's
    variables and functions get "Scope" references. A scope reference is
    an occurrence of that un-flattened variable in the flattened
    hierarchy. A module that occurs only once in the hierarchy will have
    a single scope and single VarScope for each variable. A module that
    occurs twice will have a scope for each occurrence, and two
    VarScopes for each variable. This allows optimizations to proceed
    across the flattened design, while still preserving the hierarchy.

8.  Additional edits and optimizations proceed on the pseudo-flat
    design. These include module references, function inlining, loop
    unrolling, variable lifetime analysis, lookup table creation, always
    splitting, and logic gate simplifications (pushing inverters, etc).

9.  Verilator orders the code. Best case, this results in a single
    "eval" function which has all always statements flowing from top to
    bottom with no loops.

10. Verilator mostly removes the flattening, so that code may be shared
    between multiple invocations of the same module. It localizes
    variables, combines identical functions, expands macros to C
    primitives, adds branch prediction hints, and performs additional
    constant propagation.

11. Verilator finally writes the C++ modules.


Key Classes Used in the Verilator Flow
--------------------------------------


``AstNode``
^^^^^^^^^^^

The AST is represented at the top level by the class ``AstNode``. This
abstract class has derived classes for the individual components (e.g.
``AstGenerate`` for a generate block) or groups of components (e.g.
``AstNodeFTask`` for functions and tasks, which in turn has ``AstFunc`` and
``AstTask`` as derived classes). An important property of the ``AstNode``
type hierarchy is that all non-final subclasses of ``AstNode`` (i.e.: those
which themselves have subclasses) must be abstract as well, and be named
with the prefix ``AstNode*``. The ``astgen`` (see below) script relies on
this.

Each ``AstNode`` has pointers to up to four children, accessed by the
``op1p`` through ``op4p`` methods. These methods are then abstracted in a
specific Ast\* node class to a more specific name. For example with the
``AstIf`` node (for ``if`` statements), ``thensp`` calls ``op2p`` to give the
pointer to the AST for the "then" block, while ``elsesp`` calls ``op3p`` to
give the pointer to the AST for the "else" block, or NULL if there is not
one. These accessors are automatically generated by ``astgen`` after
parsing the ``@astgen`` directives in the specific ``AstNode`` subclasses.

``AstNode`` has the concept of a next and previous AST - for example the
next and previous statements in a block. Pointers to the AST for these
statements (if they exist) can be obtained using the ``back`` and ``next``
methods.

It is useful to remember that the derived class ``AstNetlist`` is at the
top of the tree, so checking for this class is the standard way to see if
you are at the top of the tree.

By convention, each function/method uses the variable ``nodep`` as a
pointer to the ``AstNode`` currently being processed.

There are notable sub-hierarchies of the ``AstNode`` sub-types, namely:

1. All AST nodes representing data types derive from ``AstNodeDType``.

2. All AST nodes representing expressions (i.e.: anything that stands for,
   or evaluates to a value) derive from ``AstNodeExpr``.


``VNVisitor``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The passes are implemented by AST visitor classes. These are implemented by
subclasses of the abstract class, ``VNVisitor``. Each pass creates an
instance of the visitor class, which in turn implements a method to perform
the pass.


``V3Graph``
^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of passes use graph algorithms, and the class ``V3Graph`` is
provided to represent those graphs. Graphs are directed, and algorithms are
provided to manipulate the graphs and to output them in `GraphViz
<https://www.graphviz.org>`__ dot format. ``V3Graph.h`` provides
documentation of this class.


``V3GraphVertex``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``V3GraphVertex`` is the base class for vertices in a graph. Vertices have
an associated ``fanout``, ``color`` and ``rank``, which may be used in
algorithms for ordering the graph. A generic ``user``/``userp`` member
variable is also provided.

Virtual methods are provided to specify the name, color, shape and style to
be used in dot output. Typically users provide derived classes from
``V3GraphVertex`` which will reimplement these methods.

Iterators are provided to access in and out edges. Typically these are used
in the form:

::

   for (V3GraphEdge *edgep = vertexp->inBeginp();
      edgep;
      edgep = edgep->inNextp()) {


``V3GraphEdge``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``V3GraphEdge`` is the base class for directed edges between pairs of
vertices. Edges have an associated ``weight`` and may also be made
``cutable``. A generic ``user``/``userp`` member variable is also provided.

Accessors, ``fromp`` and ``top`` return the "from" and "to" vertices
respectively.

Virtual methods are provided to specify the label, color and style to be
used in dot output. Typically users provided derived classes from
``V3GraphEdge`` which will reimplement these methods.


``V3GraphAlg``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the base class for graph algorithms. It implements a ``bool``
method, ``followEdge`` which algorithms can use to decide whether an edge
is followed. This method returns true if the graph edge has weight greater
than one and a user function, ``edgeFuncp`` (supplied in the constructor)
returns ``true``.

A number of predefined derived algorithm classes and access methods are
provided and documented in ``V3GraphAlg.cpp``.


``DfgGraph``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data-flow graph based combinational logic optimizer (DFG optimizer)
converts an ``AstModule`` into a ``DfgGraph``. The graph represents the
combinational equations (~continuous assignments) in the module, and for the
duration of the DFG passes, it takes over the role of the represented
``AstModule``. The ``DfgGraph`` keeps holds of the represented ``AstModule``,
and the ``AstModule`` retains all other logic that is not representable as a
data-flow graph. At the end of optimization, the combinational logic
represented by the ``DfgGraph`` is converted back into AST form and is
re-inserted into the corresponding ``AstModule``. The ``DfgGraph`` is distinct
from ``V3Graph`` for efficiency and other desirable properties which make
writing DFG passes easier.


``DfgVertex``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``DfgGraph`` represents combinational logic equations as a graph of
``DfgVertex`` vertices. Each sub-class of ``DfgVertex`` corresponds to an
expression (a sub-class of ``AstNodeExpr``), a constanat, or a variable
reference. LValues and RValues referencing the same storage location are
represented by the same ``DfgVertex``. Consumers of such vertices read as the
LValue, writers of such vertices write the RValue. The bulk of the final
``DfgVertex`` sub-classes are generated by ``astgen`` from the corresponding
``AstNode`` definitions.


Scheduling
----------

Verilator implements the Active and NBA regions of the SystemVerilog scheduling
model as described in IEEE 1800-2017 chapter 4, and in particular sections
4.5 and Figure 4.1. The static (verilation time) scheduling of SystemVerilog
processes is performed by code in the ``V3Sched`` namespace. The single
entry-point to the scheduling algorithm is ``V3Sched::schedule``. Some
preparatory transformations important for scheduling are also performed in
``V3Active`` and ``V3ActiveTop``. High level evaluation functions are
constructed by ``V3Order``, which ``V3Sched`` invokes on subsets of the logic
in the design.

Scheduling deals with the problem of evaluating 'logic' in the correct order
and the correct number of times in order to compute the correct state of the
SystemVerilog program. Throughout this section, we use the term 'logic' to
refer to all SystemVerilog constructs that describe the evolution of the state
of the program. In particular, all SystemVerilog processes and continuous
assignments are considered 'logic', but not for example variable definitions
without initialization or other miscellaneous constructs.


Classes of logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step in the scheduling algorithm is to gather all the logic present
in the design, and classify it based on the conditions under which the logic
needs to be evaluated.

The classes of logic we distinguish between are:

- SystemVerilog ``initial`` processes, that need to be executed once at
  startup.

- Static variable initializers. These are a separate class as they need to be
  executed before ``initial`` processes.

- SystemVerilog ``final`` processes.

- Combinational logic. Any process or construct that has an implicit
  sensitivity list with no explicit sensitivities is considered 'combinational'
  logic. This includes among other things, ``always @*`` and ``always_comb``
  processes, and continuous assignments. Verilator also converts some other
  ``always`` processes to combinational logic in ``V3Active`` as described
  below.

- Clocked logic. Any process or construct that has an explicit sensitivity
  list, with no implicit sensitivities is considered 'clocked' (or
  'sequential') logic. This includes among other things ``always`` and
  ``always_ff`` processes with an explicit sensitivity list.

Note that the distinction between clocked logic and combinational logic is only
important for the scheduling algorithm within Verilator as we handle the two
classes differently. It is possible to convert clocked logic into combinational
logic if the explicit sensitivity list of the clocked logic is the same as the
implicit sensitivity list of the equivalent combinational logic would be. The
canonical examples are: ``always @(a) x = a;``, which is considered to be
clocked logic by Verilator, and the equivalent ``assign x = a;``, which is
considered to be combinational logic. ``V3Active`` in fact converts all clocked
logic to combinational logic whenever possible, as this provides advantages for
scheduling as described below.

There is also a 'hybrid' logic class, which has both explicit and implicit
sensitivities. This kind of logic does not arise from a SystemVerilog
construct, but is created during scheduling to break combinational cycles.
Details of this process and the hybrid logic class are described below.


Scheduling of simple classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SystemVerilog ``initial`` and ``final`` blocks can be scheduled (executed) in an
arbitrary order.

Static variable initializers need to be executed in source code order in case
there is a dependency between initializers, but the ordering of static variable
initialization is otherwise not defined by the SystemVerilog standard
(particularly, in the presence of hierarchical references in static variable
initializers).

The scheduling algorithm handles all three of these classes the same way and
schedules the logic in these classes in source code order. This step yields the
``_eval_static``, ``_eval_initial`` and ``_eval_final`` functions which execute
the corresponding logic constructs.


Scheduling of clocked and combinational logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For performance, clocked and combinational logic needs to be ordered.
Conceptually this minimizes the iterations through the evaluation loop
presented in the reference algorithm in the SystemVerilog standard (IEEE
1800-2017 section 4.5), by evaluating logic constructs in data-flow order.
Without going into a lot of detail here, accept that well thought out ordering
is crucial to good simulation performance, and also enables further
optimizations later on.

At the highest level, ordering is performed by ``V3Order::order``, which is
invoked by ``V3Sched::schedule`` on various subsets of the combinational and
clocked logic as described below. The important thing to highlight now is that
``V3Order::order`` operates by assuming that the state of all variables driven
by combinational logic are consistent with that combinational logic. While this
might seem subtle, it is very important, so here is an example:

::
  always_comb d = q + 2;
  always @(posedge clock) q <= d;


During ordering, ``V3Order`` will assume that ``d`` equals ``q + 2`` at the
beginning of an evaluation step. As a result it will order the clocked logic
first, and all downstream combinational logic (like the assignment to ``d``)
will execute after the clocked logic that drives inputs to the combinational
logic, in data-flow (or dependency) order. At the end of the evaluation step,
this ordering restores the invariant that variables driven by combinational
logic are consistent with that combinational logic (i.e.: the circuit is in a
settled/steady state).

One of the most important optimizations for performance is to only evaluate
combinational logic, if its inputs might have changed. For example, there is no
point in evaluating the above assignment to ``d`` on a negative edge of the
clock signal. Verilator does this by pushing the combinational logic into the
same (possibly multiple) event domains as the logic driving the inputs to that
combinational logic, and only evaluating the combinational logic if at least
one driving domains have been triggered. The impact of this activity gating is
very high (observed 100x slowdown on large designs when turning it off), it is
the reason we prefer to convert clocked logic to combinational logic in
``V3Active`` whenever possible.

The ordering procedure described above works straight forward unless there are
combinational logic constructs that are circularly dependent (a.k.a.: the
UNOPTFLAT warning). Combinational scheduling loops can arise in sound
(realizable) circuits as Verilator considers each SystemVerilog process as a
unit of scheduling (albeit we do try to split processes into smaller ones to
avoid this circularity problem whenever possible, this is not always possible).


Breaking combinational loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Combinational loops are broken by the introduction of instances of the 'hybrid'
logic class. As described in the previous section, combinational loops require
iteration until the logic is settled, in order to restore the invariant that
combinationally driven signals are consistent with the combinational logic.

To achieve this, ``V3Sched::schedule`` calls ``V3Sched::breakCycles``, which
builds a dependency graph of all combinational logic in the design, and then
breaks all combinational cycles by converting all combinational logic that
consumes a variable driven via a 'back-edge' into hybrid logic. Here
'back-edge' just means a graph edge that points from a higher rank vertex to a
lower rank vertex in some consistent ranking of the directed graph. Variables
driven via a back-edge in the dependency graph are marked, and all
combinational logic that depends on such variables is converted into hybrid
logic, with the back-edge driven variables listed as explicit 'changed'
sensitivities.

Hybrid logic is handled by ``V3Order`` mostly in the same way as combinational
logic, with two exceptions:

- Explicit sensitivities of hybrid logic are ignored for the purposes of
  data-flow ordering with respect to other combinational or hybrid logic. I.e.:
  an explicit sensitivity suppresses the implicit sensitivity on the same
  variable. This cold also be interpreted as ordering the hybrid logic as if
  all variables listed as explicit sensitivities were substituted as constants
  with their current values.

- The explicit sensitivities are included as an additional driving domain of
  the logic, and also cause evaluation when triggered.

This means that hybrid logic is evaluated when either any of its implicit
sensitivities might have been updated (the same way as combinational logic, by
pushing it into the domains that write those variables), or if any of its
explicit sensitivities are triggered.

The effect of this transformation is that ``V3Order`` can proceed as if there
are no combinational cycles (or alternatively, under the assumption that the
back-edge driven variables don't change during one evaluation pass). The
evaluation loop invoking the ordered code, will then re-invoke it on a follow
on iteration, if any of the explicit sensitivities of hybrid logic have
actually changed due to the previous invocation, iterating until all the
combinational (including hybrid) logic have settled.

One might wonder if there can be a race condition between clocked logic
triggered due to a combinational signal change from the previous evaluation
pass, and a combinational loop settling due to hybrid logic, if the clocked
logic reads the not yet settled combinationally driven signal. Such a race is
indeed possible, but our evaluation is consistent with the SystemVerilog
scheduling semantics (IEEE 1800-2017 chapter 4), and therefore any program that
exhibits such a race has non-deterministic behaviour according to the
SystemVerilog semantics, so we accept this.


Settling combinational logic after initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the beginning of simulation, once static initializer and ``initial`` blocks
have been executed, we need to evaluate all combinational logic, in order to
restore the invariant utilized by ``V3Order`` that the state of all
combinationally driven variables are consistent with the combinational logic.

To achieve this, we invoke ``V3Order::order`` on all of the combinational and
hybrid logic, and iterate the resulting evaluation function until no more
hybrid logic is triggered. This yields the `_eval_settle` function which is
invoked at the beginning of simulation, after the `_eval_initial`.


Partitioning logic for correct NBA updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``V3Order`` can order logic corresponding to non-blocking assignments (NBAs) to
yield correct simulation results, as long as all the sensitivity expressions of
clocked logic triggered in the Active scheduling region of the current time
step are known up front. I.e.: the ordering of NBA updates is only correct if
derived clocks that are computed in an Active region update (that is, via a
blocking or continuous assignment) are known up front.

We can ensure this by partitioning the logic into two regions. Note these
regions are a concept of the Verilator scheduling algorithm and they do not
directly correspond to the similarly named SystemVerilog scheduling regions
as defined in the standard:

- All logic (clocked, combinational and hybrid) that transitively feeds into,
  or drives, via a non-blocking or continuous assignments (or via any update
  that SystemVerilog executes in the Active scheduling region), a variable that
  is used in the explicit sensitivity list of some clocked or hybrid logic, is
  assigned to the 'act' region.

- All other logic is assigned to the 'nba' region.

For completeness, note that a subset of the 'act' region logic, specifically,
the logic related to the pre-assignments of NBA updates (i.e.: AstAssignPre
nodes), is handled separately, but is executed as part of the 'act' region.

Also note that all logic representing the committing of an NBA (i.e.: Ast*Post)
nodes) will be in the 'nba' region. This means that the evaluation of the 'act'
region logic will not commit any NBA updates. As a result, the 'act' region
logic can be iterated to compute all derived clock signals up front.

The correspondence between the SystemVerilog Active and NBA scheduling regions,
and the internal 'act' and 'nba' regions, is that 'act' contains all Active
region logic that can compute a clock signal, while 'nba' contains all other
Active and NBA region logic. For example, if the only clocks in the design are
top level inputs, then 'act' will be empty, and 'nba' will contain the whole of
the design.

The partitioning described above is performed by ``V3Sched::partition``.


Replication of combinational logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will separately invoke ``V3Order::order`` on the 'act' and 'nba' region
logic.

Combinational logic that reads variables driven from both 'act' and 'nba'
region logic has the problem of needing to be re-evaluated even if only one of
the regions updates an input variable. We could pass additional trigger
expressions between the regions to make sure combinational logic is always
re-evaluated, or we can replicate combinational logic that is driven from
multiple regions, by copying it into each region that drives it. Experiments
show this simple replication works well performance-wise (and notably
``V3Combine`` is good at combining the replicated code), so this is what we do
in ``V3Sched::replicateLogic``.

In ``V3Sched::replicateLogic``, in addition to replicating logic into the 'act'
and 'nba' regions, we also replicate combinational (and hybrid) logic that
depends on top level inputs. These become a separate 'ico' region (Input
Combinational logic), which we will always evaluate at the beginning of a
time-step to ensure the combinational invariant holds even if input signals
have changed. Note that this eliminates the need of changing data and clock
signals on separate evaluations, as was necessary with earlier versions of
Verilator).


Constructing the top level `_eval` function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To construct the top level `_eval` function, which updates the state of the
circuit to the end of the current time step, we invoke ``V3Order::order``
separately on the 'ico', 'act' and 'nba' logic, which yields the `_eval_ico`,
`_eval_act`, and `_eval_nba` functions. We then put these all together with the
corresponding functions that compute the respective trigger expressions into
the top level `_eval` function, which on the high level has the form:

::
  void _eval() {
    // Update combinational logic dependent on top level inptus ('ico' region)
    while (true) {
      _eval__triggers__ico();
      // If no 'ico' region trigger is active
      if (!ico_triggers.any()) break;
      _eval_ico();
    }


    // Iterate 'act' and 'nba' regions together
    while (true) {

      // Iterate 'act' region, this computes all derived clocks updaed in the
      // Active scheduling region, but does not commit any NBAs that executed
      // in 'act' region logic.
      while (true) {
        _eval__triggers__act();
        // If no 'act' region trigger is active
        if (!act_triggers.any()) break;
        // Remember what 'act' triggers were active, 'nba' uses the same
        latch_act_triggers_for_nba();
        _eval_act();
      }


      // If no 'nba' region trigger is active
      if (!nba_triggers.any()) break;

      // Evaluate all other Active region logic, and commti NBAs
      _eval_nba();
    }
  }


Timing
------

Timing support in Verilator utilizes C++ coroutines, which is a new feature in
C++20. The basic idea is to represent processes and tasks that await a certain
event or simulation time as coroutines. These coroutines get suspended at the
await, and resumed whenever the triggering event occurs, or at the expected
simulation time.

There are several runtime classes used for managing such coroutines defined in
``verilated_timing.h`` and ``verilated_timing.cpp``.

``VlCoroutineHandle``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A thin wrapper around an ``std::coroutine_handle<>``. It forces move semantics,
destroys the coroutine if it remains suspended at the end of the design's
lifetime, and prevents multiple ``resume`` calls in the case of
``fork..join_any``.

``VlCoroutine``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Return value of all coroutines. Together with the promise type contained
within, it allows for chaining coroutines – resuming coroutines from up the
call stack. The calling coroutine's handle is saved in the promise object as a
continuation, that is, the coroutine that must be resumed after the promise's
coroutine finishes. This is necessary as C++ coroutines are stackless, meaning
each one is suspended independently of others in the call graph.

``VlDelayScheduler``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class manages processes suspended by delays. There is one instance of this
class per design. Coroutines ``co_await`` this object's ``delay`` function.
Internally, they are stored in a heap structure sorted by simulation time in
ascending order. When ``resume`` is called on the delay scheduler, all
coroutines awaiting the current simulation time are resumed. The current
simulation time is retrieved from a ``VerilatedContext`` object.

``VlTriggerScheduler``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class manages processes that await events (triggers). There is one such
object per each trigger awaited by coroutines. Coroutines ``co_await`` this
object's ``trigger`` function. They are stored in two stages – `uncommitted`
and `ready`. First, they land in the `uncommitted` stage, and cannot be
resumed. The ``resume`` function resumes all coroutines from the `ready` stage
and moves `uncommitted` coroutines into `ready`. The ``commit`` function only
moves `uncommitted` coroutines into `ready`.

This split is done to avoid self-triggering and triggering coroutines multiple
times. See the `Scheduling with timing` section for details on how this is
used.

``VlDynamicTriggerScheduler``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like ``VlTriggerScheduler``, ``VlDynamicTriggerScheduler`` manages processes
that await triggers. However, it does not rely on triggers evaluated externally
by the 'act' trigger eval function. Instead, it is also responsible for trigger
evaluation. Coroutines that make use of this scheduler must adhere to a certain
procedure:

::
  __Vtrigger = 0;
  <locals and inits required for trigger eval>
  while (!__Vtrigger) {
      co_await __VdynSched.evaluation();
      <pre updates>;
      __Vtrigger = <trigger eval>;
      [optionally] co_await __VdynSched.postUpdate();
      <post updates>;
  }
  co_await __VdynSched.resumption();

The coroutines get resumed at trigger evaluation time, evaluate their local
triggers, optionally await the post update step, and if the trigger is set,
await proper resumption in the 'act' eval step.

``VlForkSync``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used for synchronizing ``fork..join`` and ``fork..join_any``. Forking
coroutines ``co_await`` its ``join`` function, and forked ones call ``done``
when they're finished. Once the required number of coroutines (set using
``setCounter``) finish execution, the forking coroutine is resumed.

Awaitable utilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are also two small utility awaitable types:

* ``VlNow`` is an awaitable that suspends and immediately resumes coroutines.
  It is used for forcing a coroutine to be moved onto the heap. See the `Forks`
  section for more detail.
* ``VlForever`` is used for blocking a coroutine forever. See the `Timing pass`
  section for more detail.

Timing pass
^^^^^^^^^^^

The visitor in ``V3Timing.cpp`` transforms each timing control into a ``co_await``.

* event controls are turned into ``co_await`` on a trigger scheduler's
  ``trigger`` method. The awaited trigger scheduler is the one corresponding to
  the sentree referenced by the event control. This sentree is also referenced
  by the ``AstCAwait`` node, to be used later by the static scheduling code.
* if an event control waits on a local variable or class member, it uses a
  local trigger which it evaluates inline. It awaits a dynamic trigger
  scheduler multiple times: for trigger evaluation, updates, and resumption.
  The dynamic trigger scheduler is responsible for resuming the coroutine at
  the correct point of evaluation.
* delays are turned into ``co_await`` on a delay scheduler's ``delay`` method.
  The created ``AstCAwait`` nodes also reference a special sentree related to
  delays, to be used later by the static scheduling code.
* ``join`` and ``join_any`` are turned into ``co_await`` on a ``VlForkSync``'s
  ``join`` method. Each forked process gets a ``VlForkSync::done`` call at the
  end.

Assignments with intra-assignment timing controls are simplified into
assignments after those timing controls, with the LHS and RHS values evaluated
before them and stored in temporary variables.

``wait`` statements are transformed into while loops that check the condition
and then await changes in variables used in the condition. If the condition is
always false, the ``wait`` statement is replaced by a ``co_await`` on a
``VlForever``. This is done instead of a return in case the ``wait`` is deep in
a call stack (otherwise the coroutine's caller would continue execution).

Each sub-statement of a ``fork`` is put in an ``AstBegin`` node for easier
grouping. In a later step, each of these gets transformed into a new, separate
function. See the `Forks` section for more detail.

Processes that use awaits are marked as suspendable. Later, during ``V3Sched``,
they are transformed into coroutines. Functions that use awaits get the return
type of ``VlCoroutine``. This immediately makes them coroutines. Note that if a
process calls a function that is a coroutine, the call gets wrapped in an
await, which means the process itself will be marked as suspendable. A virtual
function is a coroutine if any of its overriding or overridden functions are
coroutines. The visitor keeps a dependency graph of functions and processes to
handle such cases.

Scheduling with timing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Timing features in Verilator are built on top of the static scheduler. Triggers
are used for determining which delay or trigger schedulers should resume. A
special trigger is used for the delay scheduler. This trigger is set if there
are any coroutines awaiting the current simulation time
(``VlDelayScheduler::awaitingCurrentTime()``).

All triggers used by a suspendable process are mapped to variables written in
that process. When ordering code using ``V3Order``, these triggers are provided
as external domains of these variables. This ensures that the necessary
combinational logic is triggered after a coroutine resumption.

There are two functions for managing timing logic called by ``_eval()``:

* ``_timing_commit()``, which commits all coroutines whose triggers were not set
  in the current iteration,
* ``_timing_resume()``, which calls `resume()` on all trigger and delay
  schedulers whose triggers were set in the current iteration.

Thanks to this separation, a coroutine awaiting a trigger cannot be suspended
and resumed in the same iteration, and it cannot be resumed before it suspends.

All coroutines are committed and resumed in the 'act' eval loop. With timing
features enabled, the ``_eval()`` function takes this form:

::
  void _eval() {
    while (true) {
      _eval__triggers__ico();
      if (!ico_triggers.any()) break;
      _eval_ico();
    }

    while (true) {
      while (true) {
        _eval__triggers__act();

        // Commit all non-triggered coroutines
        _timing_commit();

        if (!act_triggers.any()) break;
        latch_act_triggers_for_nba();

        // Resume all triggered coroutines
        _timing_resume();

        _eval_act();
      }
      if (!nba_triggers.any()) break;
      _eval_nba();
    }
  }

Forks
^^^^^

After the scheduling step, forks sub-statements are transformed into separate
functions, and these functions are called in place of the sub-statements. These
calls must be without ``co_await``, so that suspension of a forked process
doesn't suspend the forking process.

In forked processes, references to local variables are only allowed in
``fork..join``, as this is the only case that ensures the lifetime of these
locals is at least as long as the execution of the forked processes. This is
where ``VlNow`` is used, to ensure the locals are moved to the heap before they
are passed by reference to the forked processes.


Multithreaded Mode
------------------

In ``--threads`` mode, the frontend of the Verilator pipeline is the same
as serial mode, up until V3Order.

``V3Order`` builds a fine-grained, statement-level dependency graph that
governs the ordering of code within a single ``eval()`` call. In serial
mode, that dependency graph is used to order all statements into a total
serial order. In parallel mode, the same dependency graph is the starting
point for a partitioner (``V3Partition``).

The partitioner's goal is to coarsen the fine-grained graph into a coarser
graph, while maintaining as much available parallelism as possible. Often
the partitioner can transform an input graph with millions of nodes into a
coarsened execution graph with a few dozen nodes, while maintaining enough
parallelism to take advantage of a modern multicore CPU. Runtime
synchronization cost is not prohibitive with so few nodes.


Partitioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our partitioner is similar to the one Vivek Sarkar described in his 1989
paper *Partitioning and Scheduling Parallel Programs for Multiprocessors*.

Let's define some terms:


Par Factor
^^^^^^^^^^

The available parallelism or "par-factor" of a DAG is the total cost to
execute all nodes, divided by the cost to execute the longest critical path
through the graph. This is the speedup you would get from running the graph
in parallel, if given infinite CPU cores available and communication and
synchronization are zero.


Macro Task
^^^^^^^^^^

When the partitioner coarsens the graph, it combines nodes together.  Each
fine-grained node represents an atomic "task"; combined nodes in the
coarsened graph are "macro-tasks". This term comes from Sarkar. Each
macro-task executes from start to end on one processor, without any
synchronization to any other macro-task during its execution.
(Synchronization only happens before the macro-task begins or after it
ends.)


Edge Contraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Verilator's partitioner, like Sarkar's, primarily relies on "edge
contraction" to coarsen the graph. It starts with one macro-task per atomic
task and iteratively combines pairs of edge-connected macro-tasks.


Local Critical Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each node in the graph has a "local" critical path. That's the critical
path from the start of the graph to the start of the node, plus the node's
cost, plus the critical path from the end of the node to the end of the
graph.

Sarkar calls out an important trade-off: coarsening the graph reduces
runtime synchronization overhead among the macro-tasks, but it tends to
increase the critical path through the graph and thus reduces par-factor.

Sarkar's partitioner, and ours, chooses pairs of macro-tasks to merge such
that the growth in critical path is minimized. Each candidate merge would
result in a new node, which would have some local critical path.  We choose
the candidate that would produce the shortest local critical path. Repeat
until par-factor falls to a target threshold. It's a greedy algorithm, and
it's not guaranteed to produce the best partition (which Sarkar proves is
NP-hard).


Estimating Logic Costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To compute the cost of any given path through the graph, Verilator
estimates an execution cost for each task. Each macro-task has an execution
cost which is the sum of its tasks' costs. We assume that communication
overhead and synchronization overhead are zero, so the cost of any given
path through the graph is the sum of macro-task execution costs. Sarkar
does almost the same thing, except that he has nonzero estimates for
synchronization costs.

Verilator's cost estimates are assigned by ``InstrCountVisitor``.  This
class is perhaps the most fragile piece of the multithread
implementation. It's easy to have a bug where you count something cheap
(eg. accessing one element of a huge array) as if it were expensive (eg.
by counting it as if it were an access to the entire array.) Even without
such gross bugs, the estimates this produce are only loosely predictive of
actual runtime cost. Multithread performance would be better with better
runtime costs estimates. This is an area to improve.


Scheduling Macro-Tasks at Runtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After coarsening the graph, we must schedule the macro-tasks for
runtime. Sarkar describes two options: you can dynamically schedule tasks
at runtime, with a runtime graph follower. Sarkar calls this the
"macro-dataflow model." Verilator does not support this; early experiments
with this approach had poor performance.

The other option is to statically assign macro-tasks to threads, with each
thread running its macro-tasks in a static order. Sarkar describes this in
Chapter 5. Verilator takes this static approach. The only dynamic aspect is
that each macro task may block before starting, to wait until its
prerequisites on other threads have finished.

The synchronization cost is cheap if the prereqs are done. If they're not,
fragmentation (idle CPU cores waiting) is possible. This is the major
source of overhead in this approach. The ``--prof-exec`` switch and the
``verilator_gantt`` script can visualize the time lost to such
fragmentation.


Locating Variables for Best Spatial Locality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After scheduling all code, we attempt to locate variables in memory such
that variables accessed by a single macro-task are close together in
memory. This provides "spatial locality" - when we pull in a 64-byte cache
line to access a 2-byte variable, we want the other 62 bytes to be ones
we'll also likely access soon, for best cache performance.

This turns out to be critical for performance. It should allow Verilator
to scale to very large models. We don't rely on our working set fitting
in any CPU cache; instead we essentially "stream" data into caches from
memory. It's not literally streaming, where the address increases
monotonically, but it should have similar performance characteristics,
so long as each macro-task's dataset fits in one core's local caches.

To achieve spatial locality, we tag each variable with the set of
macro-tasks that access it. Let's call this set the "footprint" of that
variable. The variables in a given module have a set of footprints. We
can order those footprints to minimize the distance between them
(distance is the number of macro-tasks that are different across any two
footprints) and then emit all variables into the struct in
ordered-footprint order.

The footprint ordering is literally the traveling salesman problem, and
we use a TSP-approximation algorithm to get close to an optimal sort.

This is an old idea. Simulators designed at DEC in the early 1990s used
similar techniques to optimize both single-thread and multi-thread
modes. (Verilator does not optimize variable placement for spatial
locality in serial mode; that is a possible area for improvement.)


Improving Multithreaded Performance Further (a TODO list)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Wave Scheduling
"""""""""""""""

To allow the Verilated model to run in parallel with the testbench, it
might be nice to support "wave" scheduling, in which work on a cycle begins
before ``eval()`` is called or continues after ``eval()`` returns. For now
all work on a cycle happens during the ``eval()`` call, leaving Verilator's
threads idle while the testbench (everything outside ``eval()``) is
working. This would involve fundamental changes within the partitioner,
however, it's probably the best bet for hiding testbench latency.


Efficient Dynamic Scheduling
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To scale to more than a few threads, we may revisit a fully dynamic
scheduler. For large (>16 core) systems it might make sense to dedicate an
entire core to scheduling, so that scheduler data structures would fit in
its L1 cache and thus the cost of traversing priority-ordered ready lists
would not be prohibitive.


Static Scheduling with Runtime Repack
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We could modify the static scheduling approach by gathering actual
macro-task execution times at run time, and dynamically re-packing the
macro-tasks into the threads also at run time. Say, re-pack once every
10,000 cycles or something. This has the potential to do better than our
static estimates about macro-task run times. It could potentially react to
CPU cores that aren't performing equally, due to NUMA or thermal throttling
or nonuniform competing memory traffic or whatever.


Clock Domain Balancing
""""""""""""""""""""""

Right now Verilator makes no attempt to balance clock domains across
macro-tasks. For a multi-domain model, that could lead to bad gantt chart
fragmentation. This could be improved if it's a real problem in practice.


Other Forms of MTask Balancing
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The largest source of runtime overhead is idle CPUs, which happens due to
variance between our predicted runtime for each MTask and its actual
runtime. That variance is magnified if MTasks are homogeneous, containing
similar repeating logic which was generally close together in source code
and which is still packed together even after going through Verilator's
digestive tract.

If Verilator could avoid doing that, and instead would take source logic
that was close together and distribute it across MTasks, that would
increase the diversity of any given MTask, and this should reduce variance
in the cost estimates.

One way to do that might be to make various "tie breaker" comparison
routines in the sources to rely more heavily on randomness, and
generally try harder not to keep input nodes together when we have the
option to scramble things.

Profile-guided optimization make this a bit better, by adjusting mtask
scheduling, but this does not yet guide the packing into mtasks.


Performance Regression
""""""""""""""""""""""

It would be nice if we had a regression of large designs, with some
diversity of design styles, to test on both single- and multi-threaded
modes. This would help to avoid performance regressions, and also to
evaluate the optimizations while minimizing the impact of parasitic noise.


Per-Instance Classes
""""""""""""""""""""

If we have multiple instances of the same module, and they partition
differently (likely; we make no attempt to partition them the same) then
the variable sort will be suboptimal for either instance. A possible
improvement would be to emit a unique class for each instance of a module,
and sort its variables optimally for that instance's code stream.


Verilated Flow
--------------

The evaluation loop outputted by Verilator is designed to allow a single
function to perform evaluation under most situations.

On the first evaluation, the Verilated code calls initial blocks, and then
"settles" the modules, by evaluating functions (from always statements)
until all signals are stable.

On other evaluations, the Verilated code detects what input signals have
changes. If any are clocks, it calls the appropriate sequential functions
(from ``always @ posedge`` statements). Interspersed with sequential
functions it calls combo functions (from ``always @*``).  After this is
complete, it detects any changes due to combo loops or internally generated
clocks, and if one is found must reevaluate the model again.

For SystemC code, the ``eval()`` function is wrapped in a SystemC
``SC_METHOD``, sensitive to all inputs. (Ideally it would only be sensitive
to clocks and combo inputs, but tracing requires all signals to cause
evaluation, and the performance difference is small.)

If tracing is enabled, a callback examines all variables in the design for
changes, and writes the trace for each change. To accelerate this process
the evaluation process records a bitmask of variables that might have
changed; if clear, checking those signals for changes may be skipped.


Coding Conventions
==================


Compiler Version and C++11
--------------------------

Verilator requires C11. Verilator does not require any newer versions, but
is maintained to build successfully with C14/C17/C20.


Indentation and Naming Style
----------------------------

We will work with contributors to fix up indentation style issues, but it
is appreciated if you could match our style:

- Use "mixedCapsSymbols" instead of "underlined_symbols".

- Uas a "p" suffix on variables that are pointers, e.g. "nodep".

- Comment every member variable.

- In the include directory, use /// to document functions the user
  calls. (This convention has not been applied retroactively.)

C and Python indentation is automatically maintained with "make format"
using clang-format version 10.0.0, and yapf for python, and is
automatically corrected in the CI actions. For those manually formatting C
code:

- Use 4 spaces per level, and no tabs.

- Use 2 spaces between the end of source and the beginning of a
  comment.

- Use 1 space after if/for/switch/while and similar keywords.

- No spaces before semicolons, nor between a function's name and open
  parenthesis (only applies to functions; if/else has a following space).


The ``astgen`` Script
---------------------

The ``astgen`` script is used to generate some of the repetitive C++ code
related to the ``AstNode`` type hierarchy. An example is the abstract ``visit``
methods in ``VNVisitor``. There are other uses, please see the ``*__gen*``
files in the bulid directories and the ``astgen`` script itself for details.  A
description of the more advanced features of ``astgen`` are provided here.


Generating ``AstNode`` members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the member s of ``AstNode`` sub-classes are generated by ``astgen``.
These are emitted as pre-processor macro definitions, which then need to be
added to the ``AstNode`` sub-classes they correspond to. Specifically ``class
AstFoo`` should contain an instance of ``ASTGEN_MEMBERS_AstFoo;`` at class
scope.  The ``astgen`` script checks and errors if this is not present. The
method generated depends on whether the class is a concrete final class, or an
abstract ``AstNode*`` base-class, and on ``@astgen`` directives present in
comment sections in the body of the ``AstNode`` sub-class definitions.


List of ``@astgen`` directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@astgen`` directives in comments contained in the body of ``AstNode``
sub-class definitions are parsed and contribute to the code generated by
``astgen``. The general syntax is ``@astgen <keywords> := <description>``,
where ``<keywords>`` determines what is being defined, and ``<description>`` is
a ``<keywords>`` dependent description of the definition. The list of
``@astgen`` directives is as follows:


``op<N>`` operand  directives
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``op1``, ``op2``, ``op3`` and ``op4`` directives are used to describe the
name and type of the up to 4 child operands of a node. The syntax of the
``<description>`` field is ``<identifier> : <type>``, where ``<identifier>``
will be used as the base name of the generated operand accessors, and
``<type>`` is one of:

1. An ``AstNode`` sub-class, defining the operand to be of that type, always
   no-null, and with an always null ``nextp()``. That is, the child node is
   always present, and is a single ``AstNode`` (as opposed to a list).

2. ``Optional[<AstNode sub-class>]``. This is just like in point 1 above, but
   defines the child node to be optional, meaning it may be null.

3. ``List[AstNode sub-class]`` describes a list operand, which means the child
   node may have a non-null ``nextp()`` and in addition the child itself may be
   null, representing an empty list.


An example of the full syntax of the directive is
``@astgen op1 := lhsp : AstNodeExpr``.

``astnode`` generates accessors for the child nodes based on these directives.
For non-list children, the names of the getter and setter both are that of the
given ``<identifier>``. For list type children, the getter is ``<identifier>``,
and instead of the setter, there an ``add<Identifier>`` method is generated
that appends new nodes (or lists of nodes) to the child list.


``alias op<N>`` operand alias directives
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a super-class already defined a name and type for a child node using the
``op<N>`` directive, but a more appropriate name exists in the context of a
sub-class, then the alias directive can be used to introduce an additional name
for the child node. The is ``alias op<N> := <identifier>`` where
``<identifier>`` is the new name. ``op<N>`` must have been defined in some
super-class of the current node.

Example: ``@astgen alias op1 := condp``


Generating ``DfgVertex`` sub-classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the ``DfgVertex`` sub-classes are generated by ``astgen``, from the
definitions of the corresponding ``AstNode`` vertices.


Additional features of ``astgen``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to generating ``AstNode`` members as described above,
``astgen`` is also use to handle some of the repetitive implementation code
that is still variable enough not to be handled in C++ macros.

In particular, ``astgen`` is used to pre-process some of the C++ source
files. For example in ``V3Const.cpp``, it is used to implement the
``visit()`` functions for each binary operation using the ``TREEOP`` macro.

The original C++ source code is transformed into C++ code in the ``obj_opt``
and ``obj_dbg`` sub-directories (the former for the optimized version of
Verilator, the latter for the debug version). So for example
``V3Const.cpp`` into ``V3Const__gen.cpp``.


Visitor Functions
-----------------

Verilator uses the "Visitor" design pattern to implement its refinement and
optimization passes. This allows separation of the pass algorithm from the
AST on which it operates. Wikipedia provides an introduction to the concept
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern.

As noted above, all visitors are derived classes of ``VNVisitor``. All
derived classes of ``AstNode`` implement the ``accept`` method, which takes
as argument a reference to an instance or a ``VNVisitor`` derived class
and applies the visit method of the ``VNVisitor`` to the invoking AstNode
instance (i.e. ``this``).

One possible difficulty is that a call to ``accept`` may perform an edit
which destroys the node it receives as argument. The
``acceptSubtreeReturnEdits`` method of ``AstNode`` is provided to apply
``accept`` and return the resulting node, even if the original node is
destroyed (if it is not destroyed it will just return the original node).

The behavior of the visitor classes is achieved by overloading the
``visit`` function for the different ``AstNode`` derived classes. If a
specific implementation is not found, the system will look in turn for
overloaded implementations up the inheritance hierarchy. For example
calling ``accept`` on ``AstIf`` will look in turn for:

::

   void visit(AstIf* nodep)
   void visit(AstNodeIf* nodep)
   void visit(AstNodeStmt* nodep)
   void visit(AstNode* nodep)

There are three ways data is passed between visitor functions.

1. A visitor-class member variable. This is generally for passing
   "parent" information down to children. ``m_modp`` is a common
   example. It's set to NULL in the constructor, where that node
   (``AstModule`` visitor) sets it, then the children are iterated, then
   it's cleared. Children under an ``AstModule`` will see it set, while
   nodes elsewhere will see it clear. If there can be nested items (for
   example an ``AstFor`` under an ``AstFor``) the variable needs to be
   save-set-restored in the ``AstFor`` visitor, otherwise exiting the
   lower for will lose the upper for's setting.

2. User attributes. Each ``AstNode`` (**Note.** The AST node, not the
   visitor) has five user attributes, which may be accessed as an
   integer using the ``user1()`` through ``user5()`` methods, or as a
   pointer (of type ``AstNUser``) using the ``user1p()`` through
   ``user5p()`` methods (a common technique lifted from graph traversal
   packages).

   A visitor first clears the one it wants to use by calling
   ``AstNode::user#ClearTree()``, then it can mark any node's
   ``user#()`` with whatever data it wants. Readers just call
   ``nodep->user()``, but may need to cast appropriately, so you'll often
   see ``VN_CAST(nodep->userp(), SOMETYPE)``. At the top of each visitor
   are comments describing how the ``user()`` stuff applies to that
   visitor class. For example:

   ::

      // NODE STATE
      // Cleared entire netlist
      //   AstModule::user1p()     // bool. True to inline this module

   This says that at the ``AstNetlist`` ``user1ClearTree()`` is called.
   Each :literal:`AstModule's `user1()` is used to indicate if we're
   going to inline it.

   These comments are important to make sure a ``user#()`` on a given
   ``AstNode`` type is never being used for two different purposes.

   Note that calling ``user#ClearTree`` is fast, it doesn't walk the
   tree, so it's ok to call fairly often. For example, it's commonly
   called on every module.

3. Parameters can be passed between the visitors in close to the
   "normal" function caller to callee way. This is the second ``vup``
   parameter of type ``AstNUser`` that is ignored on most of the visitor
   functions. V3Width does this, but it proved more messy than the above
   and is deprecated. (V3Width was nearly the first module written.
   Someday this scheme may be removed, as it slows the program down to
   have to pass vup everywhere.)


Iterators
---------

``VNVisitor`` provides a set of iterators to facilitate walking over
the tree. Each operates on the current ``VNVisitor`` class (as this)
and takes an argument type ``AstNode*``.

``iterate``
   Applies the ``accept`` method of the ``AstNode`` to the visitor
   function.

``iterateAndNextIgnoreEdit``
   Applies the ``accept`` method of each ``AstNode`` in a list (i.e.
   connected by ``nextp`` and ``backp`` pointers).

``iterateAndNextNull``
   Applies the ``accept`` method of each ``AstNode`` in a list, only if
   the provided node is non-NULL. If a node is edited by the call to
   ``accept``, apply ``accept`` again, until the node does not change.

``iterateListBackwards``
   Applies the ``accept`` method of each ``AstNode`` in a list, starting
   with the last one.

``iterateChildren``
   Applies the ``iterateAndNextNull`` method on each child ``op1p``
   through ``op4p`` in turn.

``iterateChildrenBackwards``
   Applies the ``iterateListBackwards`` method on each child ``op1p``
   through ``op4p`` in turn.


Caution on Using Iterators When Child Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visitors often replace one node with another node; V3Width and V3Const
are major examples. A visitor which is the parent of such a replacement
needs to be aware that calling iteration may cause the children to
change. For example:

::

   // nodep->lhsp() is 0x1234000
   iterateAndNextNull(nodep->lhsp());  // and under covers nodep->lhsp() changes
   // nodep->lhsp() is 0x5678400
   iterateAndNextNull(nodep->lhsp());

Will work fine, as even if the first iterate causes a new node to take
the place of the ``lhsp()``, that edit will update ``nodep->lhsp()`` and
the second call will correctly see the change. Alternatively:

::

   lp = nodep->lhsp();
   // nodep->lhsp() is 0x1234000, lp is 0x1234000
   iterateAndNextNull(lp); **lhsp=NULL;**  // and under covers nodep->lhsp() changes
   // nodep->lhsp() is 0x5678400, lp is 0x1234000
   iterateAndNextNull(lp);

This will cause bugs or a core dump, as lp is a dangling pointer. Thus
it is advisable to set lhsp=NULL shown in the \*'s above to make sure
these dangles are avoided. Another alternative used in special cases
mostly in V3Width is to use acceptSubtreeReturnEdits, which operates on
a single node and returns the new pointer if any. Note
acceptSubtreeReturnEdits does not follow ``nextp()`` links.

::

   lp = acceptSubtreeReturnEdits(lp)


Identifying Derived Classes
---------------------------

A common requirement is to identify the specific ``AstNode`` class we
are dealing with. For example a visitor might not implement separate
``visit`` methods for ``AstIf`` and ``AstGenIf``, but just a single
method for the base class:

::

   void visit(AstNodeIf* nodep)

However that method might want to specify additional code if it is
called for ``AstGenIf``. Verilator does this by providing a ``VN_IS``
method for each possible node type, which returns true if the node is of
that type (or derived from that type). So our ``visit`` method could
use:

::

   if (VN_IS(nodep, AstGenIf) {
     <code specific to AstGenIf>
   }

Additionally the ``VN_CAST`` method converts pointers similar to C++
``dynamic_cast``. This either returns a pointer to the object cast to
that type (if it is of class ``SOMETYPE``, or a derived class of
``SOMETYPE``) or else NULL. (However, for true/false tests use ``VN_IS``
as that is faster.)


.. _Testing:

Testing
=======

For an overview of how to write a test see the BUGS section of the
`Verilator Manual <https://verilator.org/verilator_doc.html>`_.

It is important to add tests for failures as well as success (for
example to check that an error message is correctly triggered).

Tests that fail should by convention have the suffix ``_bad`` in their
name, and include ``fails = 1`` in either their ``compile`` or
``execute`` step as appropriate.


Preparing to Run Tests
----------------------

For all tests to pass you must install the following packages:

-  SystemC to compile the SystemC outputs, see http://systemc.org

-  Parallel::Forker from CPAN to run tests in parallel, you can install
   this with e.g. "sudo cpan install Parallel::Forker".

-  vcddiff to find differences in VCD outputs. See the readme at
   https://github.com/veripool/vcddiff

-  Cmake for build paths that use it.


Controlling the Test Driver
---------------------------

Test drivers are written in PERL. All invoke the main test driver script,
which can provide detailed help on all the features available when writing
a test driver.

::

   test_regress/driver.pl --help

For convenience, a summary of the most commonly used features is provided
here. All drivers require a call to ``compile`` subroutine to compile the
test. For run-time tests, this is followed by a call to the ``execute``
subroutine. Both of these functions can optionally be provided with a hash
table as argument specifying additional options.

The driver.pl script assumes by default that the source Verilog file name
matches the test script name. So a test whose driver is
``t/t_mytest.pl`` will expect a Verilog source file ``t/t_mytest.v``.
This can be changed using the ``top_filename`` subroutine, for example

::

   top_filename("t/t_myothertest.v");

By default all tests will run with major simulators (Icarus Verilog, NC,
VCS, ModelSim, etc) as well as Verilator, to allow results to be
compared. However if you wish a test only to be used with Verilator, you
can use the following:

::

   scenarios(vlt => 1);

Of the many options that can be set through arguments to ``compiler`` and
``execute``, the following are particularly useful:

``verilator_flags2``
  A list of flags to be passed to verilator when compiling.

``fails``
  Set to 1 to indicate that the compilation or execution is intended to fail.

For example the following would specify that compilation requires two
defines and is expected to fail.

::

   compile(
      verilator_flags2 => ["-DSMALL_CLOCK -DGATED_COMMENT"],
      fails => 1,
      );


Regression Testing for Developers
---------------------------------

Developers will also want to call ./configure with two extra flags:

``--enable-ccwarn``
   Causes the build to stop on warnings as well as errors. A good way to
   ensure no sloppy code gets added, however it can be painful when it
   comes to testing, since third party code used in the tests (e.g.
   SystemC) may not be warning free.

``--enable-longtests``
   In addition to the standard C, SystemC examples, also run the tests
   in the ``test_regress`` directory when using *make test*'. This is
   disabled by default as SystemC installation problems would otherwise
   falsely indicate a Verilator problem.

When enabling the long tests, some additional PERL modules are needed,
which you can install using cpan.

::

   cpan install Parallel::Forker

There are some traps to avoid when running regression tests

- When checking the MANIFEST, the test will fail on unexpected code in the
  Verilator tree. So make sure to keep any such code outside the tree.

- Not all Linux systems install Perldoc by default. This is needed for the
  ``--help`` option to Verilator, and also for regression testing.  This
  can be installed using cpan:

  ::

    cpan install Pod::Perldoc

  Many Linux systems also offer a standard package for this. Red
  Hat/Fedora/Centos offer *perl-Pod-Perldoc*', while
  Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint offer \`perl-doc'.

- Running regression may exhaust resources on some Linux systems,
  particularly file handles and user processes. Increase these to
  respectively 16,384 and 4,096. The method of doing this is system
  dependent, but on Fedora Linux it would require editing the
  ``/etc/security/limits.conf`` file as root.


Manual Test Execution
---------------------

A specific regression test can be executed manually. To start the
"EXAMPLE" test, run the following command.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

Verilator uses GitHub Actions which automatically tests the master branch
for test failures on new commits. It also runs a daily cron job to validate
all of the tests against different OS and compiler versions.

Developers can enable Actions on their GitHub repository so that the CI
environment can check their branches too by enabling the build workflow:

-  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

-  Under your repository name, click Actions.

-  In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to enable ("build").

-  Click Enable workflow.


Fuzzing
-------

There are scripts included to facilitate fuzzing of Verilator. These
have been successfully used to find a number of bugs in the frontend.

The scripts are based on using `American fuzzy
lop <https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/>`__ on a Debian-like system.

To get started, cd to "nodist/fuzzer/" and run "./all". A sudo password may
be required to setup the system for fuzzing.


Debugging
=========


Debug Levels
------------

The "UINFO" calls in the source indicate a debug level. Messages level 3
and below are globally enabled with ``--debug``. Higher levels may be
controlled with ``--debugi <level>``. An individual source file levels may
be controlled with ``-debugi-<srcfile> <level>``. For example ``--debug
--debugi 5 --debugi-V3Width 9`` will use the debug binary at default
debug level 5, with the V3Width.cpp file at level 9.


--debug
-------

When you run with ``--debug`` there are two primary output file types
placed into the obj_dir, .tree and .dot files.


.dot Output
-----------

Dot files are dumps of internal graphs in `Graphviz
<https://www.graphviz.org>`__ dot format. When a dot file is dumped,
Verilator will also print a line on stdout that can be used to format the
output, for example:

::

   dot -Tps -o ~/a.ps obj_dir/Vtop_foo.dot

You can then print a.ps. You may prefer gif format, which doesn't get
scaled so can be more useful with large graphs.

For interactive graph viewing consider `xdot
<https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py>`__ or `ZGRViewer
<http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html>`__. If you know of better
viewers (especially for large graphs) please let us know.


.tree Output
------------

Tree files are dumps of the AST Tree and are produced between every major
algorithmic stage. An example:

::

     NETLIST 0x90fb00 <e1> {a0ah}
    1: MODULE 0x912b20 <e8822> {a8ah}  top  L2 [P]
   *1:2: VAR 0x91a780 <e74#> {a22ah} @dt=0xa2e640(w32)  out_wide [O] WIRE
    1:2:1: BASICDTYPE 0xa2e640 <e2149> {e24ah} @dt=this(sw32)  integer kwd=integer range=[31:0]

The following summarizes the above example dump, with more detail on each
field in the section below.

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``1:2:``      | The hierarchy of the ``VAR`` is the ``op2p``           |
|               | pointer under the ``MODULE``, which in turn is the     |
|               | ``op1p`` pointer under the ``NETLIST``                 |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``VAR``       | The AstNodeType (e.g. ``AstVar``).                     |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``0x91a780``  | Address of this node.                                  |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``<e74>``     | The 74th edit to the netlist was the last              |
|               | modification to this node.                             |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``{a22ah}``   | This node is related to the source filename            |
|               | "a", where "a" is the first file read, "z" the 26th,   |
|               | and "aa" the 27th. Then line 22 in that file, then     |
|               | column 8 (aa=0, az=25, ba=26, ...).                    |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``@dt=0x...`` | The address of the data type this node contains.       |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``w32``       | The data-type width() is 32 bits.                      |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``out_wide``  | The name() of the node, in this case the name of the   |
|               | variable.                                              |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``[O]``       | Flags which vary with the type of node, in this        |
|               | case it means the variable is an output.               |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

In more detail the following fields are dumped common to all nodes. They
are produced by the ``AstNode::dump()`` method:

Tree Hierarchy
   The dump lines begin with numbers and colons to indicate the child
   node hierarchy. As noted above, ``AstNode`` has lists of items at the
   same level in the AST, connected by the ``nextp()`` and ``prevp()``
   pointers. These appear as nodes at the same level. For example after
   inlining:

   ::

       NETLIST 0x929c1c8 <e1> {a0} w0
      1: MODULE 0x92bac80 <e3144> {e14} w0  TOP_t  L1 [P]
      1:1: CELLINLINE 0x92bab18 <e3686#> {e14} w0  v -> t
      1:1: CELLINLINE 0x92bc1d8 <e3688#> {e24} w0  v__DOT__i_test_gen -> test_gen
      ...
      1: MODULE 0x92b9bb0 <e503> {e47} w0  test_gen  L3
      ...

AstNode type
   The textual name of this node AST type (always in capitals). Many of
   these correspond directly to Verilog entities (for example ``MODULE``
   and ``TASK``), but others are internal to Verilator (for example
   ``NETLIST`` and ``BASICDTYPE``).

Address of the node
   A hexadecimal address of the node in memory. Useful for examining
   with the debugger. If the actual address values are not important,
   then using the ``--dump-tree-addrids`` option will convert address
   values to short identifiers of the form ``([A-Z]*)``, which is
   hopefully easier for the reader to cross reference throughout the
   dump.

Last edit number
   Of the form ``<ennnn>`` or ``<ennnn#>`` , where ``nnnn`` is the
   number of the last edit to modify this node. The trailing ``#``
   indicates the node has been edited since the last tree dump (which
   typically means in the last refinement or optimization pass). GDB can
   watch for this, see << /Debugging >>.

Source file and line
   Of the form ``{xxnnnn}``, where C{xx} is the filename letter (or
   letters) and ``nnnn`` is the line number within that file. The first
   file is ``a``, the 26th is ``z``, the 27th is ``aa`` and so on.

User pointers
   Shows the value of the node's user1p...user5p, if non-NULL.

Data type
   Many nodes have an explicit data type. "@dt=0x..." indicates the
   address of the data type (AstNodeDType) this node uses.

   If a data type is present and is numeric, it then prints the width of
   the item. This field is a sequence of flag characters and width data
   as follows:

   -  ``s`` if the node is signed.

   -  ``d`` if the node is a double (i.e a floating point entity).

   -  ``w`` always present, indicating this is the width field.

   -  ``u`` if the node is unsized.

   -  ``/nnnn`` if the node is unsized, where ``nnnn`` is the minimum
      width.

Name of the entity represented by the node if it exists
   For example for a ``VAR`` it is the name of the variable.

Many nodes follow these fields with additional node specific
information. Thus the ``VARREF`` node will print either ``[LV]`` or
``[RV]`` to indicate a left value or right value, followed by the node
of the variable being referred to. For example:

::

   1:2:1:1: VARREF 0x92c2598 <e509> {e24} w0  clk [RV] <- VAR 0x92a2e90 <e79> {e18} w0  clk [I] INPUT

In general, examine the ``dump()`` method in ``V3AstNodes.cpp`` of the node
type in question to determine additional fields that may be printed.

The ``MODULE`` has a list of ``CELLINLINE`` nodes referred to by its
``op1p()`` pointer, connected by ``nextp()`` and ``prevp()`` pointers.

Similarly the ``NETLIST`` has a list of modules referred to by its
``op1p()`` pointer.


.tree.dot Output
----------------

``*.tree.dot`` files are dumps of the AST Tree in `Graphviz
<https://www.graphviz.org>`__ dot format. This can be used to
visualize the AST Tree. The vertices correspond to ``AstNode``
instances, and the edges represent the pointers (``op1p``,
 ``op2p``, etc) between the nodes.


Debugging with GDB
------------------

The test_regress/driver.pl script accepts ``--debug --gdb`` to start
Verilator under gdb and break when an error is hit or the program is about
to exit. You can also use ``--debug --gdbbt`` to just backtrace and then
exit gdb. To debug the Verilated executable, use ``--gdbsim``.

If you wish to start Verilator under GDB (or another debugger), then you
can use ``--debug`` and look at the underlying invocation of
``verilator_dbg``. For example

::

   t/t_alw_dly.pl --debug

shows it invokes the command:

::

   ../verilator_bin_dbg --prefix Vt_alw_dly --x-assign unique --debug
     -cc -Mdir obj_dir/t_alw_dly --debug-check -f input.vc t/t_alw_dly.v

Start GDB, then ``start`` with the remaining arguments.

::

   gdb ../verilator_bin_dbg
   ...
   (gdb) start --prefix Vt_alw_dly --x-assign unique --debug -cc -Mdir
             obj_dir/t_alw_dly --debug-check  -f input.vc t/t_alw_dly.v
             > obj_dir/t_alw_dly/vlt_compile.log
   ...
   Temporary breakpoint 1, main (argc=13, argv=0xbfffefa4, env=0xbfffefdc)
       at ../Verilator.cpp:615
   615         ios::sync_with_stdio();
   (gdb)

You can then continue execution with breakpoints as required.

To break at a specific edit number which changed a node (presumably to
find what made a <e#*#*> line in the tree dumps):

::

   watch AstNode::s_editCntGbl==####

Then, when the watch fires, to break at every following change to that
node:

::

   watch m_editCount

To print a node:

::

   pn nodep
   # or: call dumpGdb(nodep)  # aliased to "pn" in src/.gdbinit
   pnt nodep
   # or: call dumpTreeGdb(nodep)  # aliased to "pnt" in src/.gdbinit

When GDB halts, it is useful to understand that the backtrace will commonly
show the iterator functions between each invocation of ``visit`` in the
backtrace. You will typically see a frame sequence something like:

::

   ...
   visit()
   iterateChildren()
   iterateAndNext()
   accept()
   visit()
   ...


Adding a New Feature
====================

Generally what would you do to add a new feature?

1. File an issue (if there isn't already) so others know what you're
   working on.

2. Make a testcase in the test_regress/t/t_EXAMPLE format, see
   :ref:`Testing`.

3. If grammar changes are needed, look at the git version of VerilogPerl's
   src/VParseGrammar.y, as this grammar supports the full SystemVerilog
   language and has a lot of back-and-forth with Verilator's grammar. Copy
   the appropriate rules to src/verilog.y and modify the productions.

4. If a new Ast type is needed, add it to the appropriate V3AstNode*.h.
   Follow the convention described above about the AstNode type hierarchy.
   Ordering of definitions is enforced by ``astgen``.

5. Now you can run "test_regress/t/t_<newtestcase>.pl --debug" and it'll
   probably fail but you'll see a
   "test_regress/obj_dir/t_<newtestcase>/*.tree" file which you can examine
   to see if the parsing worked. See also the sections above on debugging.

6. Modify the later visitor functions to process the new feature as needed.


Adding a New Pass
-----------------

For more substantial changes you may need to add a new pass. The simplest
way to do this is to copy the ``.cpp`` and ``.h`` files from an existing
pass. You'll need to add a call into your pass from the ``process()``
function in ``src/verilator.cpp``.

To get your pass to build you'll need to add its binary filename to the
list in ``src/Makefile_obj.in`` and reconfigure.


"Never" features
----------------

Verilator ideally would support all of IEEE, and has the goal to get close
to full support. However the following IEEE sections and features are not
anticipated to be ever implemented for the reasons indicated.

IEEE 1800-2017 3.3 modules within modules
    Little/no tool support, and arguably not a good practice.
IEEE 1800-2017 6.12 "shortreal"
    Little/no tool support, and easily promoted to real.
IEEE 1800-2017 11.11 Min, typ, max
    No SDF support so will always use typical.
IEEE 1800-2017 11.12 "let"
    Little/no tool support, makes difficult to implement parsers.
IEEE 1800-2017 20.15 Probabilistic functions
    Little industry use.
IEEE 1800-2017 20.16 Stochastic analysis
    Little industry use.
IEEE 1800-2017 20.17 PLA modeling
    Little industry use and outdated technology.
IEEE 1800-2017 31 Timing checks
    No longer relevant with static timing analysis tools.
IEEE 1800-2017 32 SDF annotation
    No longer relevant with static timing analysis tools.
IEEE 1800-2017 33 Config
    Little/no tool support or industry use.
