*******************
Language Extensions
*******************

The following additional constructs are the extensions Verilator supports
on top of standard Verilog code.  Using these features outside of comments
or "`ifdef`"'s may break other tools.

.. option:: `__FILE__

   The :option:`\`__FILE__` define expands to the current filename as a
   string, like C++'s __FILE__.  This Verilator feature added in 2006 was
   incorporated into the IEEE 1800-2009 standard.

.. option:: `__LINE__

   The :option:`\`__LINE__` define expands to the current filename as a
   string, like C++'s __LINE__.  This Verilator feature added in 2006 was
   incorporated into the IEEE 1800-2009 standard.

.. option:: `error [string]

   This will report an error when encountered, like C++'s #error.

.. option:: $c([string], ...);

   The string will be embedded directly in the output C++ code at the point
   where the surrounding Verilog code is compiled.  It may either be a
   standalone statement (with a trailing ; in the string), or a function
   that returns up to a 32-bit number (without a trailing ;). This can be
   used to call C++ functions from your Verilog code.

   String arguments will be put directly into the output C++ code, except
   the word 'this' (i.e.: the object pointer) might be replaced with a
   different pointer as Verilator might implement logic with non-member
   functions. For this reason, any references to class members must be made
   via an explicit 'this->' pointer dereference.

   Expression arguments will have the code to evaluate the expression
   inserted.  Thus to call a C++ function, :code:`$c("func(",a,")")` will
   result in :code:`func(a)` in the output C++ code.  For input arguments,
   rather than hard-coding variable names in the string
   :code:`$c("func(a)")`, instead pass the variable as an expression
   ::code:`$c("func(",a,")")`.  This will allow the call to work inside
   Verilog functions where the variable is flattened out, and also enable
   other optimizations.

   If you will be reading or writing any Verilog variables inside the C++
   functions, the Verilog signals must be declared with
   :option:`/*verilator&32;public*/` metacomments.

   You may also append an arbitrary number to $c, generally the width of
   the output; :code:`signal_32_bits = $c32("...");`.  This allows for
   compatibility with other simulators which require a differently named
   PLI function name for each different output width.

.. option:: $display, $write, $fdisplay, $fwrite, $sformat, $swrite

   Format arguments may use C fprintf sizes after the % escape.  Per the
   Verilog standard, %x prints a number with the natural width, and %0x
   prints a number with minimum width.  Verilator extends this so %5x
   prints 5 digits per the C standard (this is unspecified in Verilog, but
   was incorporated into the 1800-2009).

.. option:: `coverage_block_off

   Specifies the entire begin/end block should be ignored for coverage
   analysis.  Must be inside a code block, e.g. within a begin/end pair.
   Same as :option:`coverage_block_off` in :ref:`Configuration Files`.

.. option:: `systemc_header

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into the output .h file's header.  Must be placed as a module
   item, e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule pair. Despite the name of
   this macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

.. option:: `systemc_ctor

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into the C++ class constructor.  Must be placed as a module
   item, e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule pair. Despite the name of
   this macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

.. option:: `systemc_dtor

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into the C++ class destructor.  Must be placed as a module
   item, e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule pair. Despite the name of
   this macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

.. option:: `systemc_interface

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into the C++ class interface.  Must be placed as a module item,
   e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule pair. Despite the name of this
   macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

.. option:: `systemc_imp_header

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into the header of all files for this C++ class implementation.
   Must be placed as a module item, e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule
   pair. Despite the name of this macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

.. option:: `systemc_implementation

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` or
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch and place it
   verbatim into a single file of the C++ class implementation.  Must be
   placed as a module item, e.g. directly inside a module/endmodule
   pair. Despite the name of this macro, this also works in pure C++ code.

   If you will be reading or writing any Verilog variables in the C++
   functions, the Verilog signals must be declared with a
   :option:`/*verilator&32;public*/` metacomment.  See also the public task
   feature; writing an accessor may result in cleaner code.

.. option:: `SYSTEMVERILOG

   The SYSTEMVERILOG, SV_COV_START and related standard defines are set by
   default when :vlopt:`--language <--language>` is "1800-\*".

.. option:: `VERILATOR

.. option:: `verilator

.. option:: `verilator3

   The VERILATOR, verilator and verilator3 defines are set by default so
   you may "\`ifdef" around tool specific constructs.

.. option:: `verilator_config

   Take remaining text up to the next :option:`\`verilog` mode switch and
   treat it as Verilator configuration commands.  See :ref:`Configuration Files`.

.. option:: `verilog

   Switch back to processing Verilog code after a
   :option:`\`systemc_... <\`systemc_header>` mode switch.  The Verilog
   code returns to the last language mode specified with
   "\`begin_keywords", or SystemVerilog if none was specified.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;clock_enable*/

   Used after a signal declaration to indicate the signal is used to gate a
   clock, and the user takes responsibility for insuring there are no races
   related to it. (Typically by adding a latch, and running static timing
   analysis.) For example:

   .. code-block:: sv

         reg enable_r /*verilator clock_enable*/;
         wire gated_clk = clk & enable_r;
         always_ff @(posedge clk)
            enable_r <= enable_early;

   The clock_enable attribute will cause the clock gate to be ignored in
   the scheduling algorithm, sometimes required for correct clock behavior,
   and always improving performance.  It's also a good idea to enable the
   :option:`IMPERFECTSCH` warning, to ensure all clock enables are properly
   recognized.

   Same as :option:`clock_enable` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;clocker*/

.. option:: /*verilator&32;no_clocker*/

   Used after a signal declaration to indicate the signal is used as clock
   or not. This information is used by Verilator to mark the signal as
   clocker and propagate the clocker attribute automatically to derived
   signals. See :vlopt:`--clk`.

   Same as :option:`clocker` and :option:`no_clocker` in configuration
   files.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;coverage_block_off*/

   Specifies the entire begin/end block should be ignored for coverage
   analysis purposes.

   Same as :option:`coverage_block_off` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;coverage_off*/

   Specifies that following lines of code should have coverage disabled.
   Often used to ignore an entire module for coverage analysis purposes.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;coverage_on*/

   Specifies that following lines of code should have coverage re-enabled
   (if appropriate :vlopt:`--coverage` flags are passed) after being
   disabled earlier with :option:`/*verilator&32;coverage_off*/`.


.. _verilator_hier_block:

.. option:: /*verilator&32;hier_block*/

   Specifies that the module is a unit of hierarchical Verilation.  This
   metacomment must be between :code:`module module_name(...);` and
   :code:`endmodule`.  The module will not be inlined nor uniquified for
   each instance in hierarchical Verilation.  Note that the metacomment is
   ignored unless the :vlopt:`--hierarchical` option is specified.

   See :ref:`Hierarchical Verilation`.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;inline_module*/

   Specifies the module the comment appears in may be inlined into any
   modules that use this module.  This is useful to speed up simulation
   runtime.  Note if using :vlopt:`--public` that signals under inlined
   submodules will be named :code:`{submodule}__DOT__{subsignal}` as C++
   does not allow "." in signal names.

   Same as :option:`inline` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;isolate_assignments*/

   Used after a signal declaration to indicate the assignments to this
   signal in any blocks should be isolated into new blocks.  When there is
   a large combinatorial block that is resulting in an ``UNOPTFLAT``
   warning, attaching this to the signal causing a false loop may clear up
   the problem.

   IE, with the following:

   .. code-block:: sv

         reg splitme /* verilator isolate_assignments*/;
         // Note the placement of the semicolon above
         always_comb begin
           if (....) begin
              splitme = ....;
              other assignments
           end
         end

   Verilator will internally split the block that assigns to "splitme" into
   two blocks:

   It would then internally break it into (sort of):

   .. code-block:: sv

         // All assignments excluding those to splitme
         always_comb begin
           if (....) begin
              other assignments
           end
         end
         // All assignments to splitme
         always_comb begin
           if (....) begin
              splitme = ....;
           end
         end

   Same as :option:`isolate_assignments` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;lint_off <msg>*/

   Disable the specified warning message for any warnings following the
   comment.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;lint_on <msg>*/

   Re-enable the specified warning message for any warnings following the
   comment.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;lint_restore*/

   After a :code:`/*verilator&32;lint_save*/`, pop the stack containing lint
   message state.  Often this is useful at the bottom of include files.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;lint_save*/

   Push the current state of what lint messages are turned on or turned off
   to a stack.  Later meta-comments may then lint_on or lint_off specific
   messages, then return to the earlier message state by using
   :code:`/*verilator&32;lint_restore*/`.  For example:

   .. code-block:: sv

         // verilator lint_save
         // verilator lint_off WIDTH
         ...  // code needing WIDTH turned off
         // verilator lint_restore

   If WIDTH was on before the lint_off, it will now be restored to on, and
   if it was off before the lint_off it will remain off.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;no_inline_module*/

   Specifies the module the comment appears in should not be inlined into
   any modules that use this module.

   Same as :option:`no_inline` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;no_inline_task*/

   Used in a function or task variable definition section to specify the
   function or task should not be inlined into where it is used.  This may
   reduce the size of the final executable when a task is used a very large
   number of times.  For this flag to work, the task and tasks below it
   must be pure; they cannot reference any variables outside the task
   itself.

   Same as :option:`no_inline` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public*/ (on parameter)

   Used after a parameter declaration to indicate the emitted C code should
   have the parameter values visible. Due to C++ language restrictions,
   this may only be used on 64-bit or narrower integral enumerations.

   .. code-block:: sv

         parameter [2:0] PARAM /*verilator public*/ = 2'b0;

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public*/ (on typedef enum)

   Used after an enum typedef declaration to indicate the emitted C code
   should have the enum values visible. Due to C++ language restrictions,
   this may only be used on 64-bit or narrower integral enumerations.

   .. code-block:: sv

         typedef enum logic [2:0] { ZERO = 3'b0 } pub_t /*verilator public*/;

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public*/ (on variable)

   Used after an input, output, register, or wire declaration to indicate
   the signal should be declared so that C code may read or write the value
   of the signal.  This will also declare this module public, otherwise use
   :code:`/*verilator&32;public_flat*/`.

   Instead of using public variables, consider instead making a DPI or
   public function that accesses the variable.  This is nicer as it
   provides an obvious entry point that is also compatible across
   simulators.

   Same as :option:`public` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public*/ (on task/function)

   Used inside the declaration section of a function or task declaration to
   indicate the function or task should be made into a C++ function, public
   to outside callers.  Public tasks will be declared as a void C++
   function, public functions will get the appropriate non-void (bool,
   uint32_t, etc) return type.  Any input arguments will become C++
   arguments to the function.  Any output arguments will become C++
   reference arguments.  Any local registers/integers will become function
   automatic variables on the stack.

   Wide variables over 64 bits cannot be function returns, to avoid
   exposing complexities.  However, wide variables can be input/outputs;
   they will be passed as references to an array of 32-bit numbers.

   Generally, only the values of stored state (flops) should be written, as
   the model will NOT notice changes made to variables in these functions.
   (Same as when a signal is declared public.)

   You may want to use DPI exports instead, as it's compatible with other
   simulators.

   Same as :option:`public` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public_flat*/ (on variable)

   Used after an input, output, register, or wire declaration to indicate
   the signal should be declared so that C code may read or write the value
   of the signal.  This will not declare this module public, which means
   the name of the signal or path to it may change based upon the module
   inlining which takes place.

   Same as :option:`public_flat` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public_flat_rd*/ (on variable)

   Used after an input, output, register, or wire declaration to indicate
   the signal should be declared public_flat (see above), but read-only.

   Same as :option:`public_flat_rd` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public_flat_rw @(<edge_list>)*/ (on variable)

   Used after an input, output, register, or wire declaration to indicate
   the signal should be declared public_flat_rd (see above), and also
   writable, where writes should be considered to have the timing specified
   by the given sensitivity edge list.  Set for all variables, ports and
   wires using the :vlopt:`--public-flat-rw` option.

   Same as :option:`public_flat_rw` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;public_module*/

   Used after a module statement to indicate the module should not be
   inlined (unless specifically requested) so that C code may access the
   module.  Verilator automatically sets this attribute when the module
   contains any public signals or \`systemc_ directives.  Also set for all
   modules when using the :vlopt:`--public` option.

   Same as :option:`public` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;sc_clock*/

   Deprecated and ignored.  Previously used after an input declaration to
   indicate the signal should be declared in SystemC as a sc_clock instead
   of a bool.  This was needed in SystemC 1.1 and 1.2 only; versions 2.0
   and later do not require clock pins to be sc_clocks and this is no
   longer needed and is ignored.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;sc_bv*/

   Used after a port declaration.  It sets the port to be of
   :code:`sc_bv<{width}>` type, instead of bool, vluint32_t or vluint64_t.
   This may be useful if the port width is parameterized and the
   instantiating C++ code wants to always have a sc_bv so it can accept any
   width.  In general you should avoid using this attribute when not
   necessary as with increasing usage of sc_bv the performance decreases
   significantly.

   Same as :option:`sc_bv` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;sformat*/

   Attached to the final argument of type "input string" of a function or
   task to indicate the function or task should pass all remaining
   arguments through $sformatf.  This allows creation of DPI functions with
   $display like behavior.  See the :file:`test_regress/t/t_dpi_display.v`
   file for an example.

   Same as :option:`sformat` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;split_var*/

   Attached to a variable or a net declaration to break the variable into
   multiple pieces typically to resolve ``UNOPTFLAT`` performance issues.
   Typically the variables to attach this to are recommended by Verilator
   itself, see :option:`UNOPTFLAT`.

   For example, Verilator will internally convert a variable with the
   metacomment such as:

   .. code-block:: sv

         logic [7:0] x [0:1]  /*verilator split_var*/;

   To:

   .. code-block:: sv

         logic [7:0] x__BRA__0__KET__ /*verilator split_var*/;
         logic [7:0] x__BRA__1__KET__ /*verilator split_var*/;

   Note that the generated packed variables retain the split_var
   metacomment because they may be split into further smaller pieces
   according to the access patterns.

   This only supports unpacked arrays, packed arrays, and packed structs of
   integer types (reg, logic, bit, byte, int...); otherwise if a split was
   requested but cannot occur a SPLITVAR warning is issued.  Splitting
   large arrays may slow down the Verilation speed, so use this only on
   variables that require it.

   Same as :option:`split_var` configuration file option.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;tag <text...>*/

   Attached after a variable or structure member to indicate opaque (to
   Verilator) text that should be passed through to the XML output as a tag,
   for use by downstream applications.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;tracing_off*/

   Disable waveform tracing for all future signals that are declared in
   this module, or instances below this module.  Often this is placed just
   after a primitive's module statement, so that the entire module and
   instances below it are not traced.

.. option:: /*verilator&32;tracing_on*/

   Re-enable waveform tracing for all future signals or instances that are
   declared.
